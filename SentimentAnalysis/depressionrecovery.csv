I feel I can't mention certain things to my GF because it may be a red flag as she is looking for a life partner and knows what she wants. 

Can't tell a parent because I'm afraid they may make me do what they think is good for me. And it may very *well* be good for me...but I might not be at that step yet. 

Or not tell a therapist because maybe their help is felt more like my situation isn't a big deal compared to what I've been through, or something I may disagree with, or just don't want to hear the truth.

I am seeking out help professionally but I'm on a waiting list, so I'm asking for temporary coping mechanisms to help until I can see a professional again. 

As my eating disorder has gotten worse I have found my depression getting worse, and alongside that the absolute exhaustion of life has hit me more than ever. I really truly don't have the energy to do anything it feels like. I know part of this has to be because of my body not having proper nutrition because of the eating disorder- but I'm truly sleeping anytime I'm not at work anymore it feels like. Even when I try to go and visit a friend it is hard to find a purpose in doing anything but sleeping once I'm there. I wanted to ask for coping mechanisms ya'll use to fight the crushing feeling of ""there is no point in doing anything but sleeping, I'm tired and there's no point in trying"" feeling as well as the physical body/mind fatigue that can come with depression. I've dealt with depression for years and used to be able to fight the fact that I didn't want to do much other than sleep but I really don't know how to fight it anymore. I don't want to sleep my life away and I feel like I am losing parts of myself because of how much I'm sleeping- losing hobbies, time with friends, ect. I'm losing myself to sleep and it's a tough feeling and I'd like to fight it, but I'm so exhausted that I can barely think of where to start. Any advice (be it a book, your coping skills, anything) on how to fight persistent depression fatigue would be much appreciated.

I have so much anxiety about being on social media that at some point i just stopped trying. I stopped posting pictures and texting then slowly became depressed.

26,Hatchet453,1642362994,"Hey guys, two years ago I was going through a major depressive episode that was making life difficult. Unfortunately, I tried LSD in an attempt to cure myself as I had heard that it had the possibility of doing so. Instead, it gave me PTSD that had destroyed my sense of self and sent me into an even deeper hell. I tried everything in the book and by some miracle I've been able to revover my sense of self and am at the final stages of recovering from depression. Unfortunately, now that I've been able to recover from that I now feel sadder/more disapppinted than ever. I never thought I would be able to pull myself out of that hell, and was ecstatic when I did. Now that I'm coming to my sense I now see how my life has taken a nose-dive. Previously, I was a very ambitious and gifted college student that had two well-paying jobs with a fortune 500 company and the U.S. government. I had a vibrant social life and girlfriend and was living my relative best years. I now realize that the reason I was originally depressed wasn't all that bad(heartbreak). I look at my life now and I am unemployed, in debt, lost two years of schooling, and lost most of my relationships.

We were in an Air Force rescue raft bound for a sunken ship a few miles off the coast. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and dragged out to sea. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the splashing of a porpoise.. also a sickening odor like that of a dead fish. The noise got closer to the raft and it was then we heard a loud hissing sound.

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a long pole, about ten feet high, sticking straight up out of the water. On top was a bulb like structure. It appeared several more times, getting closer to the raft. The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. We panicked. All five of us put on our fins and went into the water.. 'Keep together and try for the ship!' I yelled.

After we were in the water, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. I got a closer look at the thing just before my last friend went under. The neck was about 12 feet long, brownish-green and smooth looking. The head was like that of a sea-turtle, except more elongated with teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a dorsal fin when it dove under for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were green with oval pupils.

I finally made it to the ship, the top of which protruded from the water, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I swam to shore and was found by the rescue unit. I know that thing was real because my friends are dead. My comrades were Eric Ruyle, Warren Salley, Larry Bill, and Bradford Rice. I live in Jacksonville now, but this happened when I lived in Fort Walton Beach. The encounter took place a few miles off the Pensacola coast. I spent a great deal of time at the Mental Health Resource Centre which is in Jacksonville. I also dealt with drug addiction and alcoholism due to the depression I've endured from people not believing me. I've had so many nervous breakdowns because I'm desperate for anyone to believe me that I've lost count. The Beany and Cecil cartoon finished airing in June of the year my friends were killed. I had a long lasting nervous breakdown that lasted for three months, until that godforsaken show finally met its end.

The world has some terrible secrets, and I know how she likes to keep them.. I have not seen the entity again since what happened when I was a teenager.",I saw Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent kill my friends and I've spent my whole life trying to get people to believe me.,1642110139.0
30,LopLegion66,1641945414,"This is gonna be a little long-winded, but I hope it reaches some of you. I hope it helps at least one person. 

There was a period in time where I was really really depressed. I didn't like who I was, nor did I like the life I was living. I hated the person I saw in the mirror. I hated the fact that I woke up every morning. Everything in life had this weird grey hue over it. Moving my body was a chore that I failed to accomplish some days, just choosing to stay in bed and eat terribly. 

I had friends, but no one really knew the depths of my depression. I found solace in food and sex. I had a lot empty relationships and clung to people that showed me the slightest bit of affection, ultimately suffocating them and forcing them out of my life. I would feel lonely in a crowded room of my closest friends and most loved family members. I didn't enjoy anything. I would be at a concert and be ripped from enjoying it by remembering how empty I felt. 

There were nights I would cry myself to sleep and pray for death. Pray that the pain of existence would end and that I could just fade in the nothingness of the universe around me. I would take walks and think about jumping into traffic, but then would think about how others around would feel. It just frustrated me that I cared so much and pissed me off that I didn't have the nerve to actually hurt myself. 

After a while I ballooned to 350 lbs and my sexual life died. I couldn't really connect with anyone on an emotional level and the pain I felt from everyday life was just too much for me to dump on any one person, so I decided that I just wanted to leave well enough alone. So I isolated myself further. I just wanted to fade into the background of life. 

It all came to a head when I had graduated from college. I had been home for a few months and decided that it should all come to an end. It just needed to stop. The pain was too much. So I started to devise a plan that would end things. On the drive while devising things, I passed by a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu school and was intrigued. I watched part of a class and decided to join. 

This is where my fortune started to turn. BJJ helped me cope with some of my darkest emotions. That gave me hope for the future. As I went to class more, I decided to work out outside of class to enhance my performance in class. That decision led me weight to just fall off. 10lbs of weight loss led to 20..30...50...and 140 lbs later, I felt like a new person. 

The weight loss helped me join the army and though there are still moments where I battle some internal demons of loneliness and depression, I have never been in a better spot in life. I finally have a small apartment of my own, a pickup truck and I'm physically healthier than I've ever been. 

This isn't a promotion for BJJ or the Army. BOTH are NOT for everyone. For me it was what I needed. 

The point of writing all this without turning it into a novel and a half is, find things that make you feel connected to others and to a part of yourself that you may not be fully aware of and things may turn around. Find things to ground you in the moment, that teach you patience and eventually as you work to better yourself, life suddenly isn't so hard to bear.",I just want to share my depression story,1641945414.0
31,slightly-productive,1641819207,"I suppose I'm posting this as a way to make things official (in my mind). I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for 9 years now. I've had multiple suicide attempts during those 9 years, but I've had the toughest past couple of months of my life. I was in the hospital every couple of days because of me trying to... well you know. I was really hopeless. I'm a college student and I ended up missing the whole of the semester and all my assignments (but for these I'll be taking them over the summer).

I spent a whole month just taking a break. Initially, I wanted to use the holidays to catch up, but my concentration has been stupendously bad. I ended up doing nothing, but I'm trying to tell myself that I needed to rest during that period. That taking care of my mental health, spending time with family, and doing stuff I like is also a productive thing to do.

My college lecturers gave me a few options with how to move forward. Most of them involved either starting over the year or taking a longer break. I chose neither. I feel like I'm absolutely crazy thinking that I can catch up to over 12 weeks + worth of learning content and pass this year. Am I? There's a part of me that feels like a reckless decision. There's the other part of me that wants to keep fighting and not give up. I really enjoy what I'm studying and it helps keep me distracted. 

On top of that, I'm required to be ""stable"" for six weeks in order to receive CBT. Essentially, I have to get better to get better. It sounds ridiculous but that's how it works where I live. 

I really hope this goes well. I'm back in my dorm as I'm writing this. My first class is tomorrow and I'm really anxious about it (because I've been getting panic attacks all the other times I've tried to attend). I still feel extremely alone in this. 

There's a saying in my language: ""*Suntok sa langit"".* In English, this literally translates to ""Punch the sky"". I think that's the best way to describe this situation.

But now, as a sophmore in college suffering from severe depession, I'm realizing that I never felt confident because of me. I felt confident because of the praise other people gave me. I don't play cello anymore, I don't draw, and I don't have any friends to make laugh anymore. I have an adoring boyfriend who loves me!

I've thought about it and I know it's selfish to relieve myself of all these feelings if I ended my life here, and transfer it to those who still loves me. But. I really can't deal with it anymore. The guilt, and sorrys, and responsibilities, are drowning me. 

I've considered, and thought about it for very long, that I'm going to end my life on my own terms, at a certain time. I haven't decided on when it will be yet, because honestly it is still a rather shaky decision at this point, knowing it'll hurt those who love me, and letting them down. But then again, I wouldn't be around to feel these burden anymore. I know it is selfish but I can't handle it anymore. I'm looking for an easy way out and this seems like one. 

I'm really drained and I'm really tired of everything. I just want out. 

I've reached out because there's no one else to talk to and I hope there'll be here. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to draw attention but I just needed to get it out.",I think I'm ready,1637349288.0

66,tehohhh,1635943600,"Hi, first time posting here. I'm just really confused and thought of reaching out to people. 

I don't know if I'm really depressed or depressed. 

Background 
M/32yrs old, married, in a good career 

I think I started feeling things like these more than 10 years ago

I don't like going out to socialise (it's a chore for me)
I don't see a purpose in my life 

I've started to think about how life is pointless and I welcome the idea of it ending (not actively suicidal), but have looked up on assisted suicides 

I don't feel happy generally
 
I stopped heading out 

I used to play guitar very frequently but now it's just sitting there, it seems like nth interests me anymore. I stopped writing songs stopped playing in general 

I feel like I want to do something but I just don't have the energy to do it. 

I feel like I'm perpetually tired. 

Insomnia had been with me for the past 10+ years (active brain, can't stop thinking bout stuffs, mainly regrets and some embarrassing moments, and other fantasy stuffs), got so bad I had to see a GP for sleeping pills for the past 6-7 years. Stopped recently as work was getting better. 

Recently kept floating the idea of welcoming death (still not actively suicidal) to my spouse and it got her upset. 

I feel like nth is going my way all the time. And bad decisions after bad decisions leading me down to path of regrets. 

I get upset over the smallest ridiculous thing. Recently I went out and got frustrated over driving because I can't seem to find the carpark to the building. 

I flare up over the minute things and I'm very ashamed of it but I just can't help it sometimes. 

I feel very restricted in this life and at times I want to drop everything. Everything. And just leave and start anew elsewhere. 

But on the other hand,

I'm performing well at work 

I have not much troubles, financially I'm doing well and my marriage is fine (had some tough issues a year ago) 

I can force myself to go out to acc my spouse, but always end up in small unhappiness.

I'm still capable of dishing out love to my love ones. And be there for them as needed. 

I'm still eating well. 

I still see exercising impt, will still try to do it maybe twice a week (run and gym), but alone all the time. 

I don't know if I'm depressed like this and I hope to see if there are others like me who will be able to give me some advice. 

I've thought of going to the clinic but if I'm formally diagnosed, it will affect my career and it's the last thing that I want. 

I feel miserable almost all the time and I just want it to stop.",I need help,1635943600.0

The other day I woke up, started getting ready for work, then all of a sudden I hate my life and I need to run away, so I quit my good paying job and drive 7 hours from Oregon to California and choose to move all within 10 min.

I have had major depressive bouts before, but they were always related to OCD episodes that got out of hand. When the obsession got managed with medication, I was back on my feet fairly easily.

This time it's been different. I just couldn't see the point in anything anymore. Life just went silent and meaningless, including, first and foremost, myself. It was as if a light had been turned off.

I suffered horrendously during the acute phase of this (last May). Then I was put on a medication regime that worked for me and I started slowly getting better.

Then I got covid (the week I was supposed to get my first shot, which I did get, not knowing I had the virus right then), and relapsed. I was terrified and lonely.

Then I recovered from covid and started to very slowly get better again. I'm on 30 mg paroxetine + 30 mg mirtazepine (they upped the dosage to help me through the covid-related fear and anxiety).

I was doing so much better, but then I started developing a neurological symptom that looks like what could be a sequel from covid. Now I'm feeling terrified again (it's a mixture from being scared of that symptom and, mostly, being scared of depression and anxiety getting out of control again).

I guess I just want someone to tell me they know what my struggle feels like and that I am more resilient that I'm currently giving myself credit for. My current negative thinking sounds like this: ""you're already on such a high dose of medication, if you relapse this is it for you, you'll always have to live in such a bleak horrifying state as you experienced last May"", or, ""you are such a lost cause"", ""feeling better will be impossible"". Even though I am more or less able to function at the moment (I can sleep, and eat all my meals, shower, take care of my daughter, occasionally feel feelings of love or enjoyment, do some yoga in the mornings, engage in conversation).

i recently started with a new therapist about 1.5 months ago and i really like her. last week i broke down because i’m so frustrated with the seemingly negative amount of progress i’ve made over 7 years, even during times i’ve tried so hard and put in so much energy into getting better. 

in response, she asked me what my goal was. what am i trying to accomplish by going to therapy? how will i know when i’ve made progress? 

over the last week, i’ve had this question on my mind constantly. and the truth is, i have no idea how to answer it. having been depressed since childhood, i don’t really know what life could or should look like when i’m “recovered.” i’m absolutely terrible at gauging how i’m feeling, since it doesn’t seem to change often, so it’s really difficult for me to say “i’ll have made progress when i feel more of x” or something.

[tl;dr] so, my question(s) to you all is this: what was the first sign of progress for you? what was the most significant? what was the most simple? what even is progress to you? what are some concrete and tangible ways your life has changed for the better?

“I’m tired,” I say, “that’s all.” And in a way, I guess that’s true. In every other way, it’s a lie. Tonight, you ask me what depression feels like.

132,Knight-Jack,1627424740,"Like, I try? But not very hard.

My psychiatrist told me I should really go to therapy, cause meds can take me only so far.

But I don't know. Don't everyone find their jobs frustratingly boring and don't know what they want to do in life? Don't everyone have problems with keeping in touch with others? Doesn't everyone hate how they look?

I realise my issues go a little deeper than that. Everything seems boring, for example. Nothing is interesting enough for me to pursue it. At the same time, I'm over 30 years old and soon enough going to uni would mean someone would get a 40-45 years old intern. Oh yeah, for sure someone would hire me. For *sure.* In the same time I know that if I stay in my current line of work - unbelievably frustratingly repetitive and boring warehouse/factory jobs - I *will...* do something silly to myself.

And it's not only ""not keeping in touch"" - I can't bond. At all, with anyone. Not even my own siblings. They're all (there's 4 of us in total) relying on each other and have stuff to talk only to each other and all. I don't. I literally talk to them about a weather, or their work - as if we were coworkers, or something, not a family, or at the very least, friends to one another (like the three of them are). It's like the three of them + me. I plan to move out of home and I just *know* they won't keep in touch, cause there's nothing to stay in touch with. And I know this, cause like a decade ago I moved to a different country and it already happened. This time I'll be moving to the other side of the city, but it'll stay the same.

I'm pathetic excuse for a human being, really. Aren't we a bonding creatures? Isn't how we survived as a spieces?

Also, probably most of people don't feel like puking whenever they pass a mirror.

But is this enough for a therapy? Shouldn't I be able to deal with this shit? Like, I don't know how, but I feel like these issues are so... small and irrelevant. I would be just wasting everyone's time.",I can't seem to be able to find motivation to find a therapist,1627424740.0

Been medicated for nearly a decade and it definitely helps me be mostly functional, but I can’t pretend I’m not still incredibly depressed a lot of the time. 
I’ve lived in the same place for nearly 7 years, and the last time I ever really did an even semi-thorough cleaning... was probably fall of 2019. Sure it’s still not perfect now, there’s still things that are is horrible shape but. It’s good enough that I feel better, and I know I’ll tackle those things soon enough. I won’t even get into how bad my place was- probably to the point where it was a health hazard. 
But anyway! I’m a little worried this won’t last long and I’ll sink back into not caring and let the mess pile up around me again, but I’m also trying not to let myself think that way. Maybe it was a little early to reward myself for it, but I’ve gone out and bought so many succulents that I’m determined to keep alive to give a little more life to my apartment since all I had before were two aloe plants who weren’t doing well thanks to neglect, but they’ve recovered nicely in the last couple weeks. :)
I’ve also bought some things for a new little makeshift desk area I set up for the small business I’ve got going on the side (took July off from that as a mental health recovery month), and it just... feels like a whole new environment now that no longer makes me embarrassed or anxious that someone will ask to come over (haven’t had anyone over since COVID started), because while it’s not perfect, it’s an improvement from how I was living before and I’m trying to stay positive that it’ll only keep getting better.

The only thing that kinda sucks is not having friends who I can really talk to about this, they don’t understand the lows or how tiny accomplishments are such a huge deal to me haha.

155,crd_52,1624509667," I had a really bad bout of depression that started in March, definitely had symptoms of moderate-severe depression. At my worst, I had some really dark thoughts, wasn't eating super healthy (not super unhealthy either, just not really caring what I ate), wasn't seeing a lot of people, and generally just felt this cloud of darkness hanging over me constantly. I was going to therapy since March, and I felt for about 2 months it wasn't really going anywhere. One of my predominant feelings was this emotional numbness and loss of identity/pleasure in the things I normally enjoy.

Since the beginning of May, I've seen improvement. I started medication (a super low dose, so not sure if it's actually helping since its technically below the lowest therapeutic dose but hey everyone's body is different). I have more energy, I don't sleep in as much, and recently I even started cooking again. I noticed I like, belly laugh a little more and I'm more silly around my friends. I think therapy is clicking a lot better for me. My family and friends say they've noticed a difference in me. So, it's progress.

But fundamentally, I still feel lost. I don't feel like myself still. Like, I haven't found my purpose in life exactly. My full range of emotions isn't back yet either. I don't feel happy/excited like I used to, don't feel as romantic, and don't feel that urge to do new things, see new places, and be curious again. Something just feels... missing. It's like my emotions are sort of back, but they're extremely muted. My emotional range feels like it's limited, almost shut off. I wonder if I'll ever be myself again - and really start LIVING life again. And of course, I've got the fear of relapsing into my worst symptoms from over a month ago. I know this might seem a little dumb... it's only been a few months of an  intense depressive episode and so expecting a full recovery after just a month and a half  is obviously unrealistic. Nevertheless, I'm just a bit confused by this almost half half state I'm in.

Ultimately, I know I've made progress. And I actually believe it. My closest friend who went through depression said all I need now is time, since I'm doing all the right things (exercise, meds, therapy, diet). But, I don't know when I'll know if I'm better. If I'll ever feel content with my recovery. It's like, I know I'm making progress but will I stick the landing? Sometimes, I feel like I'm putting my faith in some sort of almost magical progress where with time things will just get better. And everyone tells me that's kind of what it's like, but I have my doubts. Who knows though. Nature is weird, and pretty incredible things can happen. Trying to be positive here, but like I said it seems like magic almost that I could just get better and *fully* recover.

I've come a long way, but it feels like it's so close yet so far. Not sure how to handle it and if anyone has felt the same way.

I really don’t want to be angry for no reason it’s so stupid. Jealousy is after all a painful emotion. See, one thing I will often do is search things like “self-harm scars are hideous”, or “people with self-harm scars are gross I would never date one”. Surprisingly, nothing like that exists on Reddit. So what I would do, is wade through the supportive comments of like 50 nice people, to find one asshole, and that’s the one I’d care about.

My life was in shambles, and it still is, but I'm doing better. And I kinda don't know what to do with that? Like, when I'm feeling alright, and I've got some time to myself, what do I do?

I'm looking around, and all my hobbies are escapism. All my habits, coping mechanisms. The way I'm used to living is all about forgetting I'm me, and trying to avoid how I feel. And I don't think I want to live that way now.

I've uninstalled every game I have on Steam probably 3 times in the last month. At some point I'll think I want to return to one, start playing, feel lackluster, get frustrated with that, realize I'm doing this for fun and if it's not fun I have no reason to do it, and delete it again.

I go for walks; there are some nice parks near where I live. But that only takes so long. I like to cook sometimes, but I only eat so much.

I live alone. The friends I have are great, but I can count them on one hand, and they all live really far away. Family too.

170,24_7-relaxation,1623292386,"I experienced my first panic attack while driving down from a trip from LA to San Diego. I don’t normally drink coffee, and it’s been a long while since I have, but I decided to have one cup that morning and I felt my heart beating pretty fast on the drive down. I had to pull over, and do a few laps of walking in a rest area. 
I collected myself and got back on the road to make it down, I got stuck in traffic, and all of a sudden I can feel myself hyperventilating! Both of my arms went numb and I can feel myself dipping in and out of consciousness. It felt like I was having a heart attack, the more I thought about it, the more it felt like one. One thing lead to another and it turned into a full blown panic attack, I pulled over to the nearest exit and my friends in the car had to call an ambulance. 
They took vitals on the ambulance and an EKG and said that my heart is beating fast and blood pressure is pretty high, and I told them I had caffeine and they told me that I had a caffeine induced panic attack. I’ve never had a panic attack if my life before and it was a very scary feeling. I was admitted to the hospital so that they can do more testing to make sure my heart and everything was fine, and sure enough it was. I’m only 33 years old. 

It’s only been a week since the panic attack, and I noticed that every time I get behind the wheel of a car or if I’m a passenger, I can feel the symptoms start setting in again. On the next weekend, I decided it’s all in my head and I decided to drive on the freeway to “Nip it in the bud” VERY bad idea, I ended up having to pull over 20 minutes in and ended up having a Panic attack again and had to call the ambulance and got admitted to the hospital again...

The hospital did tests again...and said everything is fine...except this time they prescribed Arivan (low dose of 0.5) I took it at the hospital and it made me feel good instantly. NOW... in my second week in, my main battle is fearing that a panic attack can come at any moment and anytime of the day, it was no longer just associated with driving anymore. 

I had a Psyc eval on the second week, and after a few question, they diagnosed me with mild depression and anxiety. A little background for me is that I‘be been working from home for about 1.6 years now since COVID and my relationship with my fiancé isn’t the best at the moment, (we were in the process of getting couples therapy) before this happened to me.

Now I’m afraid that I will have panic attacks everyday, I wake up so anxious now, and I don’t want to rely on Ativan to make me feel better and run away from the fear. I want to face it, so that I don’t become addicted to the meds. My doc said though that the best way to overcome this is a combination of meds. And therapy.

I have my first therapy appointment is 2 weeks from now, should I continue to take the meds “as needed” until then?

I've spent the last 28 years believing something was inherently wrong with me because my crippling depression and anxiety would *not* go away. No matter how much therapy I did (CBT) or how many medications I tried, my mental health kept getting worse. I felt so hopeless I became suicidal and was hospitalized.

In the hospital, I was told that my current therapist wasn't helping me. He practices CBT, and while it helped in some ways with some things, but I still felt awful most of the time. The professionals in the hospital suggested I might have unresolved trauma and should start seeing a trauma specialist. (Seeing a specialist is important. Many everyday therapists aren't educated about trauma.) I started seeing a new therapist outside of the hospital and was finally correctly diagnosed with CPTSD. I had no idea CPTSD was even a thing, and I had no idea you can get it from emotional abuse alone. I'd never been hit, I wasn't a victim of a violent crime, and I wasn't a veteran, so I didn't think I could possibly have PTSD. I do.

Now I'm getting proper trauma therapy (EMDR + talk therapy) and I'm FINALLY GETTING BETTER!! I can't believe I'm saying it, it still doesn't feel real. I've never, *ever* thought I could live a normal, happy life, and here I fucking am bitchessssss!!!

179,Johnn_Davis,1621914446,"Today, over 26% of adults in the United States suffer from depression. It seems that this statistic will only get worse in the future, with depression projected to be the second biggest cause of disability by 2020. Naturally, many people are left looking for ways to cope with this often debilitating condition.

Can video games help people with depression? While there are negative stereotypes associated with video games — that people spend hours playing in order to avoid real life — studies have shown that gaming can be a powerful treatment for depression for people of all ages.

**The Opposite of Play**

Psychologist Brian Sutton-Smith found that people are more confident, energetic and emotionally positive when they play, and he felt that the opposite of play isn’t work, as most people might assume, but depression. The symptoms of depression are in contrast to those of play, and people who feel depressed lack physical energy, find it difficult to carry out daily tasks, and are generally pessimistic. Fortunately, Sutton-Smith’s findings are in line with what other scientific studies have found: video gamers experience neurological benefits from playing.

**This is Your Brain on Video Games**

When a person plays a video game, two parts of their brain are in a constant state of stimulation. The first is the part of the brain that processes goals and motivation, also called reward pathways. The other is the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning. 

If you’ve ever played a video game before, this may be intuitive. When playing, you focus on a specific goal and are motivated to take the steps required to reach that goal, whether that be to solve a puzzle, battle bad guys, or find hidden treasure. The closer you get to the goal, the more the brain’s reward pathways are activated. When a person is depressed, those two parts of the brain shrink. Gaming can help stimulate those parts of the brain, keeping them active and healthy.

**A Video Game Designed Specifically to Treat Depression**

While most video games can have positive effects on the brain and mood, SPARX was invented specifically to combat depression. The fantasy game included aspects of cognitive behavioral therapy, though this isn’t obvious to the player. In the game, players create their own avatar and then seek to destroy GNATs, an acronym for “gloomy, negative, automatic thoughts.” In the destroying of these creatures, players learn that those types of thoughts aren’t true or necessary to live with —  that they could be destroyed. 

The New Zealand-based researchers who created the game found impressive results in their study. Approximately 44% of SPARX players recovered from depression, compared to 26% of patients in treatment. Additionally, 66% of the gaming group saw a reduction in symptoms of 30% or more, compared to 58% of patients in treatment who saw the same reduction in symptoms. 

**To Play or Not to Play?**

Some people who are depressed may turn to video games as a way to self-medicate. This is why some research can be skewed; it can look like gamers have a high likelihood of depression, which can lead to the assumption that gaming has caused it. However, it’s also possible that a lot of people with depression turn to gaming and actually experience a decrease in symptoms. Turning to gaming for medicinal purposes becomes a problem when the gamer attempts to escape their life instead of treating their issues. 

Carefully choosing which games are played and ensuring those games have a positive outcome for the player is key to using gaming in a healthy way. For example:

* A game like *Words with Friends* can help players connect with others socially, while *Minecraft* can increase an individual’s creativity. 
* For veterans in treatment, Wii games may be used to encourage a broader range of movement. Medical technology means that veterans survive more injuries than in the past, but there are also more veterans returning home with physical, mental and emotional issues that require treatment. 
* Gamers can improve their confidence and problem-solving skills, making them more apt to deal with real life instead of feeling the need to escape it.

**Final Thoughts**

Fighting depression is difficult, and it can impact everything from functioning during daily life to sexual performance, not to mention self-harm and suicidal thoughts. When treatment options feel heavy, threatening, or stressful, it’s less likely that the individual will seek out help. Also, children and teens may not know how to express what they’re going through, and depression can remain undiagnosed. 

Video games, whether they’re regular games or specifically designed to improve symptoms of depression, may help some people feel better and engage with life in a more meaningful way. It may be a powerful way to combat depression.

200,SquareSurprise,1618404756,"I would like some advice on how to apologise to some of my workmates for my behaviour while depressed + thank my mangers for supporting me while I was depressed.  

I am sure some may say that there is no need to apologise for a health concern that is not my fault. However, I would find it appropriate to apologise to people if a physical health issue meant I couldn't do my regular duties, so this is really no different. I also feel there may be some explanation/acknowledgement required because there are some people caught up in this who may not have known what was going on, and I think that will make it difficult to move forward from. 

   
 This is the situation in a rough nutshell:  

* Have a long history of depression, however usually able to function at work without much damage done if I just keep my head down on particularly low days. I've worked for my company for about 10 years, and while I am sure no one would be surprised to hear I have dealt with depression it has never created an issue for other people.
*  Earlier this year, I went through a major depressive episode lasting about 3 months, of which 4 weeks in particular were some of the worst I had ever experienced 
*  I work full time in a professional environment. While this was happening I carried on working, although feeling very upset and resentful about things going on at work. In hindsight, these were issues I could usually brush off, but at the time they felt like they were at the root cause of my poor mood, leading me to make some critical/snarky comments at work about various issues on a fairly regular basis.
* Throughout this period, I managed to do my job (the bare basics at least), but felt extremely irritable, lacking energy, completely flat, and constantly on edge of tears. I cut myself off from my workmates and just tried to keep my head down in work. This was partly to save my energy, partly because I knew how unpleasant I was to be around.  
* When my colleagues did interact with me, I was often snappy, or just plain unenthusiastic, to the point that they couldn't have helped but notice. They eventually stopped asking me to join them for lunch-not to be mean, but because they could sense (correctly) that it only irritated me.  People also stopped asking me for any favours, stopping off for a chat, etc. When they saw me around they always smiled and said hello, but I could tell people were walking around on eggshells, not wanting to bother me.  
* After a few weeks of this, my direct manager called me for a meeting to ask how I was, and I burst into tears in her office and basically told her I hated my job (true at the time). She was very kind in trying to unpack this for me, and exploring with me how we could try to change some things to make work life easier/better. After about an hour long discussion, we made a plan to meet again in the coming days to discuss further.  
* Before we had time to meet, I was asked to take on quite a large job at the last minute because of some unplanned leave. It was something that would cause me a high amount of pressure and inconvenience, however it was ultimately a reasonable request to have been put on me. However, I had an absolute meltdown in front of several of my colleagues (initially anger directed at them, followed by uncontrollable sobbing). Everyone was extremely kind and basically moved mountains trying to direct the work off me, showed me genuine concern for my wellbeing and didn't make me feel like shit about it, despite my reaction really being very unreasonable/unprofessional.    
* Very first thing the next day, the head of our department called me into her office to ask what was going on. Once again, I burst into tears, and again basically just said how much I hated my job. Like my line manager, she spent a lot of time unpacking this with me, and I eventually told her honestly a lot of what was happening with my mental health e.g. my history of depression, that I was currently trialling medications that were not working, what I felt on an average day, etc. I am a super private person who rarely discusses this with anyone, let alone my manager. She spent about an hour just listening to all this, and offering ways to support including things that would be of significant impact on our department (changed hours, change in work role, paid time off, etc), all of which I appreciated, but declined. She told me that the offer stood, and we made a plan to have a weekly meeting to check in for the foreseeable future-which she has done to date.  

 About 10 days after the above happened, things started to finally turn a corner with me mood, and I am currently feeling a whole lot better (though unsure how long that will last). In my current moment of clarity, I am hugely embarrassed about some of my behaviour. Although I know what was happening inside my head at the time, there is still such a thing as right and wrong, and some of the ways I spoke to people + my behaviour in general was inappropriate workplace behaviour, which truly did negatively impact on the team. And so I want to apologise for that, I also want to explain myself to some extent to my work colleagues who wouldn't really know why I was acting like that toward them. I would also like to thank/acknowledge my managers for acting so totally supportive, as I am fully aware some people in my shoes would not have gotten the same support/reception, and this all took additional time for them to manage.  

At any time, my mood will slip back to how things were previously (this is more than likely), so this is really not something I can just put behind me entirely and move on from. I feel like this is something that will only be more noticeable going forward, and will become an elephant in the room if I just try to go on from this never saying anything about it.

However, what I DON'T want is for this to come off in any way performative, seeking any attention or making my “mental health issues” a bigger issue than they need to be. Unfortunately this may be hard to do as I am quite likely to become quite emotional in discussing this (due to embarassment and/or gratitude with some of these events), which I want to avoid. Essentially I want to professionally acknowledge the impact this had on my workplace, thank the people who deserve thanking, apologise to the people who need an apology, and try to move on and put this behind me as much as I can.

Hopefully this is the right space/place to post this. I've seen a few posts about people sharing stories and what recovery looks like, which made me think that maybe some of the members of this community would want to share their stories in a piece of academic research? Currently looking for men to share their stories.

Little bit about me: I'm Nick, I'm a PhD student working out of De Montfort University, Leicester, UK. My research interests are in the processes involved in facilitating recovery through depression and using photography as a creative means of communication. Basically what I ask people to do is follow a couple of tasks over a few weeks which explores their relationship with their depression, themselves, other people and what's important to them, and then we have a chat (interview) about those pictures. I have had my own personal journey with depression and recovery and relapse, and recovery again, and part of my process is to speak about the issue and try and help others. 

Anyway before this turns into a wall of text and I ramble on, I will leave an advert on this post and I will comment directly which a snippet of what I have done so far on this project.

I know a lot of you here want some answer but if you gonna ask me what heals my depression? It was God that heals my depression as well as following some [**ways and methods**](https://startawareness.com/7-hidden-ways-to-overcome-depression-without-medication/) that actually helps me to become a better person. These methods really help me a lot. 

Honestly, I almost become crazy because of depression why? because of the heaviness of the problem that I carry by myself against the people I love but I cannot shout it out since they are a family. The one that causes my depression. 

No matter how painful my feelings were, I didn't even dare to talk to anyone of them whom I know all of them vs against me. I just let the 3 years pass carrying those burdens by myself. But God healed me in an instant because I long for healing deep inside my heart almost every day. I cried God for help, I kneeled, I read bible, I really ask God to help me, to let me understand why? because my burdens were so heavy.

And believe me or not but in an instant after 3 years of carrying those burdens, I was healed immediately just by hearing this small verse.  ***""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.""*** Just this verse that I cried heavily I cannot stop my tears, it's falling heavily, I cannot stop them for an hour.

Those verse made me realized that who am I to value my sufferings when Jesus being condemned by the people He loves so much yet we people made fun of Him, persecuted Him, punished Him, how cruel we are to do these things to Him yet He still shouts to God and asks, ***""Lord forgive them for they do not know what they are doing"".***

&amp;#x200B;

That moment I realized my problem was so petty.

It's nothing compared to Him. As in nothing, my problem has no value. Instantly I see my problem like not a problem anymore. I don't feel any burdens anymore, I see gladness inside my heart and happiness. I felt happy and I clearly understand why things now are happening to me.

I've wasted so much food, cause my brain literally just went ""i'd rather starve"". Preparing also takes energy (and eating never seem to make me any more energetic, so these efforts always seem in vain), so it needs to be short.

My meds are helping me to get through the day - get up, get dressed, go to work and not fall on the floor, crying and miserable. I might be on brink of tears at all times and sometimes I need a timeout in the toilet for an anxiety attack, but I manage and people seem to view me as a normal human being.

It's the food that stumps me. I *try* to eat healthy. On good days, it works. I balance the meals, I keep an eye on calories, I meal prep on weekends, so I could have more time to rest during weekdays. And when a bad day or two happen, I'm prepared and good to go anyway. And I still eat healthy.

But this row of bad days is entering it's third week now. (I'm under a care of psychiatrist, who is trying her best to put be back into the therapy, so no worries). I ran out of the meal preps long time ago. I reversed into eating frozen, starchy foods and fried eggs and I really, really try balancing it out, but my brain just doesn't want to work this way.

And it's always like that. I lose some weight due to the healthy eating, I feel better about myself, and then my mind goes under and I get fatter again, and I feel disgusted again.

知 - To know
足 - Satisfaction
常 - Often
樂 - Happy

Hi all. I had a sad but ultimately positive day today.
I’ve been clinically depressed and prone to severe anxiety since I was about thirteen (I’m 26 now). For the longest time I was on SSRIs and getting ineffective counselling from various therapists, and at least twice every year in the past I’ve had huge downswings and extended depressive episodes that have cost me friends, grades and even jobs. 
Last year, I finally found an incredible psychiatrist who put me straight on tricyclics and laid out a recovery plan for me. It has been twelve months, and I feel like a person again. I have ups and downs of course, but most days I feel the way I imagine colourblind people feel when they put on those magic glasses. Things literally seem brighter and more beautiful.
Anyway, today I had to take one of my pet chickens to the vet, and she had to be put down.  I was really sad about it, and have been crying on and off, but all day I have felt kind of strange, like something was weird about my reaction. I only figured it out when I talked it out with my mum - it’s the first time that I can remember that I’ve known exactly why I’m sad, and that sadness hasn’t completely paralysed me. I was so used to just feeling sad and crying for no reason that having a ‘normal’ reaction to something sad freaked me out.

I've been living mostly alone for the past 10 years. I used to have a girlfriend around most of the time (spending at most 6 months in between relationships single and slightly depressed) so I wasn't alone for too long, but ever since I moved to San Francisco, I didn't have a real relationship for 3 years. And then the pandemic hit, and I was alone. I was fine with this for about a month, but I started getting super anxious, depressed, and suicidal and wasn't able to concentrate much on work. I reached out to some friends living in a different state and they invited me to come stay with them.

I ended up staying for 6 months. At first, my anxiety and depression quickly lifted, but then it slowly became worse again. I ended up avoiding my friends, going on long walks for most of the day. I stopped working and went on medical leave. I also started waking up at 5am every day, which is a symptom of depression that I didn't know about. I stupidly decided to move back to San Francisco to try to ""shake things up"" to feel better, and things did get better for a few weeks. I was learning new things, working on hobbies, spending time in nature, and seeing friends about every other day. And then, one day I woke up at 1am with crippling anxiety (chest pain) and depression, and started researching ways to kill myself.

I told some friends, and they sprung into action (I have good friends). They picked me up and had me stay with them. They've been helping me coordinate my treatment and motivating me to accomplish daily tasks. I feel a lot better when I'm staying with people, so I've been bouncing around different friends' houses for 3 weeks now. I have a few other friends I could stay with but I don't think I could stay with them for the remainder of the pandemic, and eventually everyone will get sick of me - everyone has their own issues to deal with and can't dedicate their life to helping mine. I could also go home and stay with my mom and stepdad, but that's not a great option because they were abusive to me when I was young (wonder where the depression comes from?) and they still yell at each other a lot.

I don't see the pandemic resolving itself anytime soon, and the friends I stayed with originally moved to a smaller place and aren't interested in having me stay with them for another 6 months (they've already done more than their fair share of keeping me alive, plus I was the one who stupidly decided to leave *them*).

I had depression this bad before, and it seems like it's always triggered by social isolation and gets better when I get more social contact. The first time this happened (10 years ago), it resolved itself after I went on prozac and got a fun job where I met cool people. The second time this happened was at the beginning of the pandemic, and it resolved itself when I went to stay with friends. Now is the third time, and it seems to be the worst of all, and triggered by ""isolation"" that isn't even that isolating - I'd been hanging out with friends somewhat regularly when it hit, but I guess seeing people for \~10 hours / week was not enough for me.

What can I do? Getting a new job won't help much because I'd just be working from home, isolated. Getting a girlfriend is impossible because I'm too depressed, and I became bald during the pandemic, and it doesn't look good on me. It will be very difficult to find a relationship even if my depression resolves itself, as I wasn't that successful even when I had hair and not depressed. Staying with friends seems difficult and is asking too much from them. Staying with my parents will probably be detrimental to my mental health, but at least my mom will make sure I'm eating every day.

And after the pandemic, am I just supposed to stay with friends indefinitely? Stay with my parents indefinitely? Get a job and use that for social support? (this is much easier in your 20s than it is in your 30s.) Overall, the situation seems hopeless - even though I have an amazing support network, it's still not enough. I feel like I need to be with people constantly or I might commit suicide. I am on prozac again but it's making the anxiety worse. I tried other anti-depressants and they just made me feel worse, too. So... that's when I started looking into residential depression treatment programs, where they can find a good medication for me and keep me safe and healthy during that time. They are super expensive, but I have money because when I'm not depressed I'm very productive and well-paid. Does anyone have experience with this? Or does anyone know what I can do to not be so dependent on being around people for happiness?

252,henlope,1612292488,"I’m at a point with my depression where I realize that if I keep snoozing at 7 and give into sleeping all day, it makes me groggy and restless and anxious and guilty all day. In the moment, it feels better though. My depression convinces me getting up is impossible, not worth it, etc. I don’t shower, don’t brush my teeth, and getting anything done feels SO impossible. 

But today I got up at 7, made my bed, took my meds, stayed awake, brushed my teeth and showered, and I feel so so much better. It has been a battle to not nap, but I know it’ll help me sleep tonight. It feels so good to be clean and have things tidy and be on top of things (all of which I have struggled with lately). 

So, my question is do you have tips on how to stay awake in the morning? How to keep this up? Deep down I know I am a morning person who is just sick. Before depression hit I was a morning person effortlessly. So I don’t know how to get that back.

255,woodmama,1612160743,"I've made a lot of progress on my depression. I've accomplished a lot, and I was so proud when I had my last therapy visit. Was I 100%? No, but I had the tools to move forward. And I knew there was only so much other people could do in the road for recovery. 
It's pretty public now that long term depression causes memory loss. It's very real for me. Until I learned this fact I was freaking out. I was always more forgetful, I couldn't remember anything really from my 10 years of depression for the most part. A lot of moments and conversations, even my college education was lost (I took a break when my depression was unbearable and then when I tried to go back I changed majors). 

I think what I didn't realize was the fact my depression took away my ability to feel whole. I've been ""recovering"" for 3 years now. I have worked hard, I have a good job, a really nice house, a fiance, and 4 cats. This is what I always wanted. I have mostly everything I have ever wanted. My only issue is I've been having a lot of financial issues (partly pandemic partly unexpected costs). I know without this debt I would feel a lot better on a stress level, but I have had this issue where I'm just not happy. I'm proud of my accomplishments. Absolutely proud. But... I am not happy. 

I thought when I had everything I wanted I'd feel good. I thought I'd hit a sigh of relief. I can settle down and just enjoy and work through whatever happens moving forward... But I don't feel that way. I have anxiety to the point I can't sleep. I am stressed even when things are fine. It feels like everyone around me can enjoy the moment a lot more. Laugh genuinely more. Be more carefree. It's just.. that's what I have been waiting to come back, but no matter what I do it doesn't. 

I guess its just never enough. I almost feel like greed in the sense I want everything and even everything isn't enough. Nothing gives me that satisfaction I desperately desire. 

Sometimes lately I think about packing up and just leaving. Telling no one. Cutting off ties with everyone. Going somewhere. Starting over. It's such an extreme, but sometimes it feels like my last hope. 

I haven't had dark thoughts in so long. But tonight they're back. It's mixed feelings. You know, the normal ""ah, fuck I don't want this"" but then ... It's kindof like a ""hello old friend"" moment. Depression should not give me comfort, but here we are I guess.  Sometimes I feel like I could sit here for hours with linkin park in my headphones and sulking about... Just anything. It's so easy to go back to that feeling. And if at least feels whole. The emotion isn't cut short. It is there, completely. It moves me. 

I've never been on anti depressants or the like. I don't want to be. We don't have enough research on them, and while it may help I have watched it first hand have side affects. I just would rather do this on my own, but maybe I'm stupid. I mean I know I am lmao but I still have my opinions.

257,littleperogi,1612099428,"About a week ago I started feeling kinda tired with feelings of anxiety (tight chest, shallow breathing, no appetite ), which is not unusual for me. I started sleeping more and more, whenever I feel like it. I usually like my hobbies of making art, music, things, anything, but I didn't have any energy or enthusiasm to do any of those things, which happens. 

But now I feel like this depression has bumped up to the next level where I wake up, and not only do I not want to do anything, I don't want to be awake. Being awake with nothing to do, and nothing to think about except maybe my own anxieties and miseries is torture. I want to just go back to sleep and shut it out but I can't because I've just slept for like 20 hours. It's torture, and I can see this spiralling to suicidal thoughts. 

I have no idea what to do. I usually see a therapist doing IFS and I've dabbled in CBT and other similar forms of therapy. I don't know... Where to even start tackling this. I'm scared, and I'm scared it will escalate to suicidal desires. 

For the past 3 days I pushed myself to practice piano and violin as something to do, which I'm really proud of myself for doing but I can't practice for all 10 hours I'm awake, and today I tried to practice again but I just got so angry and frustrated everytime I messed up.","No will to be alive /awake, it's getting worse, and I don't know what to do",1612099428.0

Then I took a closer look and I realised that horrible sinking feeling could be anxiety, then I thought my aversion to doing anything and sense of dread could actually be anxiety. The lines were very blurry. 

So I decided I am going to approach this from a totally different perspective as if it were anxiety by doing tasks and facing a fear. Anyway there has been a major shift as a result with postive results. 

Not saying this is the case for everyone but they are both a stress response and can become very similar or even identical at points. If it is anxiety causing depression and not the other way around you may find  your anxiety is much easier to get at and resolve.

So I had an almost complete relapse thanks to constant trauma I've been experiencing. First, my grandfather almost died from covid back in March.  Thanks to that, I struggled hard with my depression. I got stable again during the summer afterwards. Then the Fall hit and the problems I was having with my roommates hit me hard. To make a long story short, my roommates were discriminating against me and my apartment complex was not helping me. So I had to move out. That was when all the not sleeping stuff started but i was still relevantly stable emotionally. Since I couldn't afford to move out into another apartment and pay tuition off, I unfortunately had to move back home. Now, I hate being home for multiple different reasons. 
One of those big reasons is my mom's husband. I don't like him nor does anyone in my family like him. The man has anger issues, he has cheated constantly on my mom, he's an animal abuser, he has at least 10 or 9 baby mamas with at least 10 kids or possibly more, and he walks around always being angry, having no compassion for anything. Him and my mom scream at each other at least once a week nor do they communicate at all effectively. Because of him I hate being home. The man has literally made mine and my lil sis's life hell to the point where even she has depression too. 
Ever since I got back home, my depression has been getting worse and worse. My sleeping is basically non-existent. I have no energy, I have no motivation, and I have no feelings at all except sadness and defeat. And once again I snapped cause he said something that wasn't bad but yesterday I had a horrible nightmare and horrible panic attack that left me really emotional. Since I don't view him as my parent, when he told me to do something in his horrible way of saying something it pissed me off. I ran upstairs to get away from him and my mom noticed which triggered me to snap at her. I immediately had another mental break down directly afterwards. And once again I didn't sleep last night. So my mom woke me up around 2 to help me clean my room cause I physically have no motivation or energy to do it myself. This in turn pissed her husband off who I overheard saying, ""you need to force her ass up to do it herself and now you not going anywhere.' Which now, I'm annoyed cause obviously he doesn't know or care what I'm going through nor does he try to help. Currently, I'm feeling horribly exhausted to the point where I keep mishearing everything my mom said to me. Now, I feel very faint and I just want to cry. Just getting up to put clothes away makes me tired. Like I physically have to keep sitting down cause I feel horribly faint.

285,Experiment1996,1609393234,"Hello all. I am 24 years old and have done PMO from age 13-22. I was extremely addicted and my sessions went on for hours at a time. I had several tabs open and developed several fetishes. Normal porn was no longer interesting for me. I have never used drugs or alcohol in my life.

After several streaks I am now at day 371 and I am still on the flatline or PAWS (Post acute withdrawal symptoms).

I have noticed the following **positive symptoms** so far:

**- Physical changes:** I am no longer skinny. I woke up after 120 days without exercise and my body was suddenly wider. My jawline has improved and my face has gained some colour. I no longer have dead eyes. The almost constant lower back pain has disappeared. It feels like my bones have been strengthened and I have gained some muscles. My prostate seems to have become smaller. -&gt; Too much PMO can cause the prostate to get bigger.

**- Memories:** Memories from childhood have come back. I can remember up to the age of 6. I can remember which children I played with and I remember positive and negative events that happened in my life so far. I also remember many details.

**- A new view of the world:** I no longer see women as sex objects. For me, women are very beautiful creatures. I want to have a normal, intimate relationship with a woman. I want to get married. I want to do everyday things with a woman like going for a walk, to the cinema, cooking, laughing, etc. Because of the negative symptoms I will list later, I don't want to approach women at the moment.

I realise that short-term rewards are not the meaning of life. You have to fight if you want something. Successful people are patient. I want to achieve more in my life. My life during my addiction: PMO, videogames, TV, school, work and isolation from the world.

My whole world view has changed. I no longer blame others for my failures and for my life. I want to work on myself every day to become a better person and to live a happy life.

**-&gt; -&gt; -&gt;**

Unfortunately, I still suffer from the following **negative symptoms:**

**- Social Anxiety / low confidence:** Has improved significantly, but I am still afraid to walk and talk in a group full of people. I still think what the others might think of me. I am afraid of failing in public or doing something embarrassing.

\- **Brain Fog:** This has improved a little, but is still not perfect. I still have poor focus and concentration. It takes me a long time to make decisions. Sometimes I have trouble expressing myself. When I talk to a person, I can't process information very well. I don't understand so quickly. I sometimes feel really stupid when I talk to people. When I watch TV or read something, I sometimes lose concentration or think about something else. I get distracted quickly. I can't access my thoughts so quickly and then speak them out.

\- **Anhedonia:** I don't really enjoy anything any more and almost nothing makes me really happy. I pursue my hobbies, such as playing football or billiards, but I don't feel any great joy in them. My feelings seem to be blocked somehow and don't come out. Everything seems to be boring somehow. I don't really enjoy anything any more and almost nothing makes me really happy. I pursue my hobbies, such as playing football or billiards, but I don't feel any great joy in them. My feelings seem to be blocked somehow and don't come out. Everything seems to be boring somehow.

**Low energy:** I have almost no energy. I go to work, pursue my hobbies, go for walks, but it feels heavy. I don't feel that energy in my body and mind.

**Low motivation:** I find it difficult to motivate myself for normal, everyday things like shopping, walking, working, reading. I have no motivation to learn a new language or to leave the house. I work from Monday to Friday and I have no motivation to work. You can see it in my face.

**Low libido:** My libido is weak. I sometimes have morning wood, but it is not very strong. I do not have spontaneous erections. If a woman touched my arm or flirted with me, I would have an erection. I could have an erection and sex with a woman, but I still don't have such a strong desire for sex. My libido is not yet as healthy as it should be.

**Fatigue:** No matter how much I sleep, I always feel tired. My whole body and mind feels tired. I can sleep in the evening and then I get tired again through the day and could fall asleep again. I often have the urge to lie in bed or rest.

**Sore muscles / body pain:** I have sore muscles or body aches every day, even if I don't do any sport. I can't tell the difference between the two. It feels like my muscles or bones are not quite healed / grown out / stable yet.

**Digestive problems / prostate:** I often have hard stools and sometimes constipation. Rarely do I have normal stools. Frequent urination is also a problem for me. My whole stomach area feels strange. I feel a strange pressure in my stomach area every day, no matter what I eat or drink. My prostate is not completely cured yet, as I reported at the beginning. I also can't lose fat and have a ""beer belly"" even though I'm not fat.

**Wet dreams:** Mostly after 7 or 8 days I get a Wet Dream or Nocturnal Emission. In dreams I am very sensitive. If a woman touches me in a dream, I get an ejaculation. After a Wet Dream my negative symptoms are more pronounced. I need 2-3 days until I am more or less normal again. When I have an wet dream, I don't feel joy during the release. It just comes out without orgasm or pleasure.

**Time perception:** The time feels a bit strange. I think it's because of the brain fog. Some days I do some things like showering, eating, shopping, walking, taking out the rubbish, vacuuming and it feels like I've done an extreme amount. So I am quickly exhausted, yet only 2-3 hours have passed.

I have had a blood test. My testosterone level is good. I take vitamin D daily and will have to start weekly vitamin B12 injections soon. I will receive an iron infusion which should last for 3 months.

I personally believe that my flatline / PAWS will end at the end of June. That would be a total of 18 months. I estimate this number because **""sikreodds97""** went on his flatline for 24 months.

I have made an effort to make this post as accurate as possible and hope that long flatliners will also get in touch to encourage me.

It's even worse because the environment isn't one that I can cope with on a weekly basis. There's a lot to deal with. My depression is really bad that I couldn't even remember how many times I've called off. I had to ask the DON when I tried calling in earlier. She said I already called off three times, and I've been called out for it by a coworker and the DON. I can only imagine the gossip about me that goes on behind my back :( 

I feel like I'm at my last straw. I've stuck it out for 5 weeks. I learned a lot, and I've pushed the boundaries of my comfort zone a bit more which I'm proud of. But the job just isn't good for me personally because of my mental health. 

I've found another job that is less intensive and I start next week. 

I'm thinking of not showing up tomorrow. I know that that's not an ""adult"" thing to do, but goddammit if I show up tomorrow I don't know how I'm going to be. I just want to be able to have enough time to cope and take care of myself.

I have a fitness tracker watch that I mainly use when I exercise. Not too fussed about my activity levels around it, I am self aware enough to know, outside of any exercise I do, I am basically a sloth/bear just out of hibernation. 

I am also quite in the void at the moment. All the symptoms involved - no need to get into it. 

There is a whole issue of my insomnia. I have the strongest feelings that my tiredness in the mornings, to get moving, is more mental than physical. I have a lot of nightmares/dreams every night. So, in the mornings, everything feels like too much mental investment. The sleep schedules don't necessarily work for me. They just instil a habit more than help me sleep better, which is fine, but the problem remains. And depression/BPD voice is loud, right now. 

I thought it would be interesting to invest in an oura/motiv ring, not to track my activities/steps, etc., but to give me decent sleep data and to know how my body is doing physically, to compare it to my mental/emotional feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone. This is my first post in this community. For over 20 years I have dealt with depression, anxiety, possibly PTSD, and other disorders (I am doing neuropsych testing next month to further diagnosis and understand fully what I am dealing with). I was first suicidal at the age of 11 and 12 and never truly got the help I needed for it. A few years later, at 16, my parents took me to a general practitioner to get help. I took Wellburtin. I remember it having no effect. Still, I generally, put my focus on school, activism, and local politics. I felt the need to be involved with something bigger than myself (I still do). Long story short, I had a few years where I didn't necessarily feel terrible, but I also attributed this and my moods to just being a teenager. 

When those moods didn't go away when I went to college, I used maladaptive coping mechanisms to get through and somehow finish both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. During that time, I did go to counseling and was prescribed Celexa. I believed this to work, not sure how well it worked, but with the combination of being with my girlfriend at the time, doing well in school, and having a good relationship with my parents, I thought I was 'cured', I even wrote a paper for my college newspaper saying so. It was my thinking at the time. But looking back, I was still using those above coping mechanisms, still missing work, still fearful, still anxious, but not as bad as it was before. I ended up marrying my girlfriend and later divorcing her a few years later. During that time, both of my parents passed away and a close in-law passed away as well. Add that in with existential trauma, childhood trauma, vicarious trauma from my job, and marital problems, I was slowly deteriorating. I had continued to use those 'bad' coping mechanisms throughout my relationship and my marriage and again, I still felt it was okay, but didn't see it at the time. On the surface, I had everything, but when I was alone, I felt completely downtrodden and awful. But suicidal thoughts were not there, but I definitely was not happy, and definitely was depressed in some ways. There was a shift in our marriage that caused me to seek help, ultimately to save my marriage, not me. I went to therapy for years and started treatment, was prescribed SSRIs, SNRIs, etc and nothing seemed to affect me. I wanted to have a story that I 'overcame depression' because I had done so before, so why couldn't I do so now? Long story short, nothing worked. My moods became more erratic, I was highly depressed, and the surface things that I mentioned above didn't help, at a deep-down level, I was hurting. 

Ultimately, I divorced my wife and started to face my demons. My ex and I are still good friends and love and support each other but we are not meant for each other anymore. I began to understand how my traumas were affecting me, why I was afraid of everything and everyone. And being alone was the worst. I was a mess. I had a therapist for three years during all these life events, and they kept the band-aid on, but they didn't get to the root issues. Post-divorce, I sought out a therapist that would help me get to the root issues. I found that therapist and she's wonderful, but those moods, that suicidality, that pain, that trauma, that anxiety, never went away. I started to do my research about mental illnesses beyond depression and anxiety, CPTSD, BPD, and the like. To be clear, I have not been diagnosed with either BPD or CPTSD but there are definitely overlaps. Over the last two years, I have tried pretty much every SSRI/SNRI, mood stabilizers, you name it with very minimal to no effect. I gave hope and just thought therapy alone and reliance on benzos would help me get through life.  

There was still a part of me that felt like I needed to say ""yes! I beat depression!"" because I was ashamed for even having said issues before and well, my family of origin didn't help me feel so great about sharing these struggles, and we have other family members that have addiction/SA issues and mental health problems. And while no parents are perfect, I felt like I needed to be the good child, and on the surface, I was, but I was barely getting by. I am not producing like I would want to be at work, my relationships aren't as close as I would like them to be, and I have pushed people away from me because I was afraid of being hurt. 

This year, 2020, has been hard for all of us. In my case, I had a whole different living situation, tried the last couple of meds that I hadn't tried in 2018 and 2019. Nothing worked. So when I had my telehealth appointment with my psychiatrist last week, she mentioned Esketamine as a potential treatment for me. I had heard of Ketamine and also microdosing for mushrooms and their effect on the brain. With my mental illnesses and just general curiosity, I have done a lot of research about the brain, its neuropathways, and how neuroplasticity can be changed. I am open to Esketamine as a treatment, despite my own internalized shame about taking a drug that has been abused. But I know that in the right, therapeutic doses, it has shown to be helpful. All of this to say...it's been a long journey with depression and other assorted mental illnesses. I don't know what it feels like to be or not have depression. I don't expect Esketamine to be a cure-all but it is very promising as a new treatment for me. Am I skeptical? Yes. Because I am afraid it will not affect me. But I am also hopeful? Yes, because that is what I am holding on to. I submitted the forms to Jansenn's program for Esketamine and I hope after my insurance is promised, along with Jansenn's rebates, that this is a treatment I can afford. I am thankful to have an employer that is supportive of me taking care of myself (I am in the helping profession), but I am also afraid of the time commitment this would take to start treatment. So, I am taking a leap of faith and trying Esketamine. I am not sure if this long post was truly allowed, but I am thankful for those reading if you did. I will put a TLDR at the bottom for those that don't/can't read this much. The story feels anticlimatic, but I'm hoping Esketamine, along with other tools, can help me get back to me and helps me feel better for the first time, maybe in a long time, maybe ever. Thanks for following along and I hope we all get the help we need in our journey.

TLDR: Trying Esketamine for treatment-resistant depression after many failed regimens of depression; past coping mechanisms were not helpful and rather harmful and I have dealt with numerous types of trauma: situational, vicarious, childhood, and otherwise. I am hopeful but scared of getting into this treatment and wondering if I could ever get back to me, and well, do I even remember what that feels like. And not sure if this allowed, but if it is, thank you for allowing me to have a platform and I hope you all have success in your depression recovery.",Taking a leap of faith for my own treatment,1609042763.0

Think of this as what you will, just some of my thoughts regarding recovery :)

Unaware of what can be said and what should be said has created a delve into one of the most challenging aspects of my adolescent life, so far. The journey of recovering is only beginning, I know the sense isn’t quite in my grasp right now but it will be. The feeling of isolation, convincing myself that there is no place here for me will fade. Patience. I imagine hearing this from a *so to say*, “stable” mind must be fairly difficult to apprehend, possibly even distressing to a small extent. I wish to have these queries. I wish to be able to wonder “*how it feels”, “how bad can it really be?”, “why does this happen?”*  In fact, these all happen to be extracts of discussions I’ve come across. Reading these felt almost alien, *how can people not know?* *How does one not have the experience of depression, of mental health? Is feeling this way not considered a normality?* I must be the only one; *I can’t be the only one.* Looking back over the past 6 years of my life, these thoughts were running through my head, every day achieving a new level of the pit, to put it metaphorically. Now, initiating the climb I am grateful for the experience. In a twisted way, I now have the knowledge that a bad day could be worse. *It’s just a bad day.* Coming to the realisation, this pit is deep; this pit is carrying years worth of derangement, the uncertainty of *""will it ever get better?"",* self-hatred and harming thoughts...this will take many years to accomplish but already I feel that tiny bit more confident that this can be done. I’ve devoted such a large percentage of my teenage life to this already, I have missed out on more than I could ever imagine…this can be completed; I will see the other side of things. Knowingly, it is difficult when all you’ve accepted is the small, unforgiving voice embedded in your mind day after day. A different type of acceptance is now needed. Healing bad the habits the voice has encouraged, their time is, the next step is waiting to be taken. It is time.",honestly just some thoughts,1607940854.0

I have things I want to do.  I had a plan for digging out of this hole.  I'm safe and have enough money, for now.  I managed to get my disabled family into a care home so that I don't have to work 90 hours a week caring for them.  Now it's only like 30 hours... because that's how long I'm on the phone every day, and counting errands for stuff they ask for which is no big deal itself.

But one of these family members... just can't recover.  She's amazingly depressed, riddled with acute anxiety, and blind.  Absolutely nothiing can satisfy her, and since care facilities are undermanned during COVID (talent drain from hot spots taking all the nurses &amp; aides with fat bonuses), there's a lot of little things every day that aren't perfect.  She has gone completely toxic and must call me 5 to 7 times per day wanting me to tell her she's right to yell at the staff and that they're not doing their jobs when it's patently clear that's a gross exaggeration.

I can't handle being accused of being heartless anymore by a person I gave up 5 years of my life to personally care for because I won't reinforce their depression.  Being gentle and nice doesn't work, being firm and blunt doesn't work, talking to the psychotherapist doesn't work, and I CAN'T MAKE IT STOP.

Now I'm having a depressive episode again, can't motivate myself to do anything but desperately try to distract myself on the Internet when I should be putting my life back together.  I'm shirking responsibilities I've committed to.  I can't cut them off; I'm their only family and they have no one else.  But I can't stand this anymore.  I don't know what to do.  I can't get through to her; any tiny hint that she should do anything different and is anything but completely perfect, helpless, and blameless is met with a shrieking meltdown and guilty aspersions.  Any attempt to take a break (such as going so far as to not call back when hung up on) is treated as a permanent betrayal and abandonment.

I've been there, but I wasn't physically as disabled as her at the time, and I didn't demand anyone take care of me; I just sat in my own filth until I recovered.

To cut a long story short, I am a year into recovery. My problem is that since I have come to terms and and navigating most of the self hatred and negative emotions. 
I have having an issue with my motivation and personal development.

Previously, due to the hatred and desire to change who and what I am, I became very self-motivated, hard working and would always go above an beyond. However, these positives where fueled by the hatred and need to change and that I didn't deserve to work so I would push myself harder. 

Now that these negative emotions are much less, I feel that I have lost my fire and I would like to recover it healthily.

""When I was at one of my lowest (mental) points in life, I couldn't get out of bed some days. I had no energy or motivation and was barely getting by.

I had therapy once per week, and on this particular week I didn't have much to 'bring' to the session. He asked how my week was and I really had nothing to say.

'What are you struggling with?' he asked.

I gestured around me and said 'I dunno man. Life.'

Not satisfied with my answer, he said 'No, what exactly are you worried about right now? What feels overwhelming? When you go home after this session, what issue will be staring at you?'

I knew the answer, but it was so ridiculous that I didn't want to say it.
I wanted to have something more substantial.
Something more profound.

But I didn't.

So I told him, 'Honestly? The dishes. It's stupid, I know, but the more I look at them the more I CAN'T do them because I'll have to scrub them before I put them in the dishwasher, because the dishwasher sucks, and I just can't stand and scrub the dishes.'

I felt like an idiot even saying it.

What kind of grown ass woman is undone by a stack of dishes? There are people out there with *actual* problems, and I'm whining to my therapist about dishes?

But he nodded in understanding and then said:

'Run the dishwasher twice.'

I began to tell him that you're not supposed to, but he stopped me.

'Why the hell aren't you supposed to? If you don't want to scrub the dishes and your dishwasher sucks, run it twice. Run it three times, who cares?! Rules do not exist.'

It blew my mind in a way that I don't think I can properly express.

That day, I went home and tossed my smelly dishes haphazardly into the dishwasher and ran it three times.

I felt like I had conquered a dragon.

The next day, I took a shower lying down.

A few days later. I folded my laundry and put them wherever the fuck they fit.

There were no longer arbitrary rules I had to follow, and it gave me the freedom to make accomplishments again.

Now that I'm in a healthier place, I rinse off my dishes and put them in the dishwasher properly. I shower standing up. I sort my laundry.

But at a time when living was a struggle instead of a blessing, I learned an incredibly important lesson:

There are no rules.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

Around 10 I started to have suicidal thoughts and around 12-13 years old I started cutting myself... Luckily I managed to overcome that part, it's been a hard process but once I managed to see further than my own depression and choose to live it became easier.

For my it was my brother who helped me realise that I wasn't better off dying... You see, my parents always used to tell us about how my brother had never cried as a baby or during his whole childhood for that matter. I had never seen a single tear in his eyes until the day he discovered all the cuts on my wrists, that was the first tear I saw...
He told our parent and I had a lot of therapy after that but nothing helped and I just didn't want to live anymore, I felt so helpless and not understood and a couple years later I tried to commit suicide but luckily I wasn't able to go through with it, I was 16 at that time. The next day my brother started playfighting and he grabbed my arm right on top of the deep cut I had and I winced in pain for a second. That second was enough for him to understand what happend, he rolled up my sleeve and saw the wound and tears started rolling from his eyes.. He hugged me and cried even harder, my strong big brother who had never cried before was now crying because of me and in that moment I realised that I never wanted to see my brother like that again and I promised him that day I would never cut myself again! It's been 11 years since then and I kept my promise!

But although I no longer want to commit suicide, my battle with depression is far from over... 
I'm still in a daily fight with myself and I have no idea how to break this cycle...
I've been to therapy, I've had antidepressants (as a last resort) but even that didn't help. I tried many things on my own too, I have a lot of support from my family yet I keep feeling like my depression is getting the better of me. It feels like the fight is getting harder everyday...

Hello everyone. I'm not really sure where to start because this is my very first post on reddit. I've been reading posts here and there on different subreddits but I decided it was time to make an account, specifically for this post. Firstly, if you take time out to read this, thank you so much! I will try to be as brief as possible, however I believe this might be quite a long post, so I apologize in advance. Also, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask for this type of advice, but here it goes:

For a bit of a background story, me (f24) and my boyfriend (m24) have been dating for a bit more than a year and a half, and he's without a doubt the love of my life. Literally couldn't think I'd ever love a person in this way. Whenever I think there's no possible way for me to fall even more in love with him, he proves me wrong. To me, he's the kindest most understanding and lovable person ever, and he is also the funniest. We have a very healthy, committed and happy relationship and he's changed my life for the better in ways I can't describe. He's my bestest friend and I wouldn't rather spending my life with anyone else, and he has expressed the same. If all goes well I'll be moving in with him soon, which we are very excited about.

However, he has been dealing with severe depression for years. I believe it started in his teens. This later evolved to things like alcohol abuse (he's been sober for a few weeks, and very committed to this, which I am so incredibly proud of) and suicidal thoughts. Recently we've had a few talks about this matter, after his depression started flaring up more often, especially when we're not together. He has always shown interest in getting better (despite sometimes feeling very hopeless), but he's not quite sure how. I have suggested therapy, but he's not really into that idea, which I respect. I have also suggested reading certain books, maybe learning more about depression and, through that, finding ways to cope and get better. And he agrees! Since his birthday is coming up, I'm going to be gifting him his favorite book series of all time (which he already knows of), but I also thought about gifting him a book related to depression and recovery.

**So, my question is:** what book/s has/have helped you with your depression and mental health in general? This goes for other resources like videos, movies, websites, articles, etc.

I'm aware that we're all different and that only certain things might work, and we're taking a step-by-step approach, tackling one thing at a time, as we go. In hopes this will help you help me, here are a few of the things he's been struggling with, that especially trigger his depression:  
\- uncertainty regarding financial stability, and the future in general;  
\- self-esteem issues regarding his image (struggles with self-love);  
\- feelings of irritation, anger and dread;  
\- being aware of the bad things going on in the world and feeling powerless;  
\- feeling not worth it/not enough (he has had suicidal thoughts, and expressed that the only reason he's been hanging on is because of me..);  
\- irregular sleeping schedule, poor diet, being indoors for too long (we've actually been tackling this and it makes a huge difference!);  
\- expressing the feeling of wanting to feel 'normal'.

I apologize for the very long post once again, and thank you if you've made it this far, I'm truly grateful. Any book that covers any of these struggles and/or depression in general would be really helpful. I'm sorry if this is not the right subreddit to post this on or if I haven't used the right trigger warnings. I will do anything in my power to help him with whatever he's going through. I myself suffer from anxious episodes and panic attacks, so I know mental health can be a very complicated thing to address.

So I just finished my last shift at my job a few hours ago. 

I decided to quit for several reasons, mainly for my mental health and safety and so I could have enough time to pursue what I want for my life. 

My job was a night shift job and I worked there ~full time for about 3 months. That may sound short but honestly that’s 3x longer than any of the other current employees (except for the manager of course). My mom and me both mutually agreed that it would be a good idea to quit.

I am hoping to make productive use of my newfound free time but I am worried I will end up wasting it and just being a depressed lump on a blanket until building self-hatred and desperation to do *literally anything* forces me to get another crappy job again.

My plan is to make a daily schedule for myself since I find having something written down helps me stick to my plans. I also have a base plan for when I sleep/eat since I can all too easily miss out on both of those for days at a time. I got some smoothies for myself so breakfast these next couple of days will be easy while I transition. I also bought ~2 weeks worth of sleeping pills that I hope will help me get a schedule going (I’ve never actually used one before).

I’ve also tried planning fun yet relaxing activities for myself that will help me feel better mentally such as hand making masks, playing online video games with friends, baking, etc.

now im fully recovered. and my grades are dipping. i have no motivation to work hard, i go to sleep when i want to, i don't push myself to work hard. before i recovered, this never happened because i hated myself too much. now that im happier, i don't get stressed by exams and deadlines. i feel like im being complacent. i don't work as hard as i used to when i was mentally unwell.

Note: Mostly posting here because I need to tell SOMEONE and I dont know who would listen irl

A little over a year ago, I (23f) made a post on an account I'm now locked out of (called ramenfaith or s/t) about how frustrating it is when you begin to recover and realize how much you've let yourself go. When you see your teeth are bad, you're very overweight, your house is a mess, and your relationships are suffering... I'm here to brag, now. I feel proud of myself these days. Shortly after I made my first post, I moved out to live on my own for the first time. My family was worried, because I was moving roughly 7,000 miles (11265 km) away from home. They worried bc they wouldn't be there to hound me about doing chores and taking care of myself and making sure I don't get into any dark places where I might relapse into sh or suicidal ideation again... But I'm starting my second year abroad, and things are going pretty well. 

I won't lie, the first year was pretty hard. My biggest struggle with keeping my home clean is doing dishes and for the first year I maybe did dishes... three times? They just sat in the sink and smelled horribly most of the time. I did laundry maybe once a month. I took out the trash almost never (the trash system here is a bit intimidating and I had anxiety about taking it out)... and my teeth got to the point of hurting almost constantly. I ordered delivery almost daily, and if I wasn't at work I was probably laying in bed... things were rough, mentally. I'd started seeing a guy who I ended up having to end things with (he was a racist and I don't waste my time on people like that) but I was sad about being single again (lol) so it was just... me moping all the time. I think I hit rock-bottom here around the end of Feb/start of March when covid happened, and then again in May when I was forced to be quarantined by my visa sponsor because I was ""possibly exposed"" to the virus (I was fine). In June, I decided enough was enough.

I threw away all the dishes in my sink. That's embarrassing but idc. I was never going to wash them and they were a huge source of my cleaning anxiety. I deep cleaned the rest of my house, did all my laundry, and down-sized. Then, my employer (who provides my housing) offered to help me find a new apartment, if I wanted. I figured it was worth a shot. We went apartment hunting and I found a loft I'm in love with, and they agreed to rent it for me, as well as give me $500 for new furniture. They even helped me move. I think having a beautiful apartment really inspires and motivates me to stay on top of things. I've been living there for about a month now, and I'm really happy with how I'm handling it. I'm staying on top of laundry, and my dishes (more or less. I have a friend I pay to do them when I let them overwhelm me). I buy groceries every week or every other week instead of ordering delivery constantly. I vacuum. I clean the glass surfaces. I dust. I know this sounds like basic-ass shit, but it was really hard for me to do those things before. I take out my trash every day on the way to work. I'm making progress. I feel like a regular fucking human. It's nice.

Oh, and in July, I went to the dentist. Turns out, the dentist I went to in the states (Aspen, if you've heard of them, the fuckin' con men) were just lying to me about all the things wrong with my mouth. Besides some stains, the only thing wrong with my teeth were that they really needed a cleaning. They look great and my mouth doesn't hurt anymore. Now, I just need to focus on losing weight...

377,41mHL,1600198145,"This question came up in a conversation with a good friend last night, and I didn't have a good answer for myself. Maybe somebody here does?

Like all of you, I struggle with depression. Some days are better than others. 

I've noticed that I hold myself accountable through others. For example, I have my kids 50% of the time. When they aren't here, I'll make sure to get things done *for them*, for example, making sure I have adequate food in the house, etc. When they're here, I rally, put on my best face, and engage with them like a good father.

A lot of times, when they leave, I'm exhausted and glad to have some time to myself. I will generally collapse to rest, which includes my usual socially-isolated habits of procrastination and distraction from my depression.

Then, before the kids come back, I hit the usual depression cycle of lamenting the things on my list that I didn't get done -- the things that I say I want to get done, but am not making progress on.

My friend reminded me to be gentle with myself, and to congratulate myself and appreciate myself for getting done the things I do get done, *in spite of* my depression, rather than holding myself to the standard I'd expect of a (hypothetical) highly motivated Type A personality without depression.

Which was kind, and an excellent reminder, because of course I make those kind of comparisons.

But I had to ask, ""How do I tell the difference between having self-compassion for my disability, and enabling myself to repeat behaviors which don't serve me?""

I remember ibuprofen definitely helped my mood,but I'm skeptical about the other effects (they say it can be bad for the liver or kidneys) and also whether or not something like that would be a crutch.

We are a small group of clinicians and software developers from England, UK, who have spent the last year trying to reduce the drop off rate for people undergoing 6 week programmes of CBT.

We experimented with many different resources to support people undergoing CBT for common issues. We experimented with the usual books, worksheets and apps. Unsurprisingly, different things worked for different people and there was no one size fits all resource or method. This led us to build our own resource to reduce the drop off rates we were seeing. 

Over the course of a year we incrementally built an app for this use case and tested it with over 100 people. We designed it to be used in between therapy sessions to reinforce lessons and help people complete their goals and exercises. Each person gets a weekly email report with a summary of their progress, their mood progression and their most common cognitive distortions. They can choose to share this with their therapist if they like. 

Two things happened that we are pleased with:

1. Not only were we able to reduce drop off rates for the 6 week programme, but we saw much higher levels of engagement during the main programme sessions. 
2. Several of our testers referred their friends to the app, as a way to get introduced to CBT. As a result, we have some early indications that it might be useful as a standalone introductory app, as well as something that can accompany professional therapy. 

Right now we’re really interested to get any thoughts or feedback on the app and how we can improve it. We’d be really grateful to hear from some users as well as clinicians if possible.

I've always struggled at work and school, but I've never just shut down and refused to attend or not worked for long periods of time on purpose before. I don't drink or do heavy drugs, but I do have a problem with weed and caffeine addiction (weed for the anxiety and to zone out, and caffeine for the depression, to feel focussed or motivated). I started therapy again for the first time in years, but I couldn't pay for the next month, so I've been without it for a week and a half. It was online and I did this thing called journaling that was really helping. 
Honestly though, every thing I was doing can be done without a therapist. The only difference was that I had created a system where I had to report these things (journaling, gratitude exercises, breathing exercises) to my therapist. After the therapy stopped though a day after starting training in a new job in a new field, I stopped doing my homework.
  
Basically, I always feel like I either have it together, I'm struggling to keep it together, I'm losing it, or I've lost it.
Some days, I screw something up at work and I laugh about it, some days I grin and bear it feeling shitty on the inside, other days I walk out...

As she started to open up to me more about her outlook on life (this was more like a year ago I guess), I slowly started to realize that she had no intention to try anymore. She kept telling me that she desperately wanted to die and that she had attempted to kill herself before. However, she would tell me about how much she would panic every time she got close to doing it. It was like her body wasn’t letting her complete the task— a survival instinct I guess. That still didn’t stop her from wanting to die though.

I should also mention she’s an alcoholic and has no intention of stopping drinking. She considers it to be a slow form of suicide and hopes to die soon because of it. 

I’m mainly coming on here to ask if anyone knows anything I can say that might help her be motivated to quit drinking or that might convince her to have some sort of will to keep on living. I’m too scared to give advice. She says that talking things through with her helps, but a lot of the things that I say in response have resulted in her having a panic attack or her getting just generally upset. I’m also just really scared to say the wrong thing— I know that she has cut off two close friends for seemingly small reasons and I’m scared that if I say something wrong I will be next. Theres no question that this friendship has taken an emotional toll on me, but I think being cut out of her life without knowing if she’s ok would definitely be worse. 

I’ve already done my part as a distraction to the emotional pain enough, I can’t just keep sitting there and saying “yeah….. of course…..that makes sense” to everything she says anymore. I feel so useless.

From a distance, I seem presentable, but when you get closer you can see how lumpy and ruined I am. 

It feels so lonely to be like this. I make people feel uncomfortable. It's strange for them to see an ugly, ruined wall which has been painted so beautifully. I don't fit in with the other crumbly walls because I'm not in ruins anymore, but I'm too ugly and cracked to build a house with. 

Most days are really good and I feel happy. I've managed to reclaim my life and overcome a lot of my struggles. But I don't feel understood by anyone. My mind wants to wallow in thoughts of anguish.

404,SuperKat111777,1598085349,"I am reaching out to share this to see if any of you might understand and could provide some insights on how to be relieved of apathy. I have overcome extreme physical pain, overcome extreme lifelong depression, overcome suicidal, overcome the rollercoaster of depression meds. In the last 3 years, I have made progress in rebuilding my career and reducing my school debt which had ballooned due to ignoring my bills for a while. I even enjoy my job now and have job security during covid times. 

**My biggest hurdle is APATHY!** Though I have managed to make progress and survive, I feel complete apathy. I have the time and ability now to try new things like learning music or reading books or anything like that but I don't. I stopped trying to make new friends or dating a while ago due to only drawing negative people in life so I don't socialize outside of work-related events. Of course, covid has put an automatic end to it. I would love nothing more than to have my own family but I know it is too late. I am 42 female. I feel like a loser still in all I do even though the journey has been hard. I am completely unable to even see how I can dream again in life, there is a strong inner belief that I am a survivor but I shouldn't expect much more than to pay bills and live quietly. After 5 years of my dog's death, I rescued a puppy recently who was a stray dog with a broken fractured leg. Despite getting her to the vet, caring deeply about her and giving her a home, I don't feel the connection that I had felt with my previous dog who had a big part of my heart. This is what has proven to me that I can't feel anything much - no joy, no excitement, no positivity...only thing is that I am not in extreme depression but I am just neutral I guess. Life is not making sense and I wish to feel differently. 

**BACKGROUND if you need to know**  
I have battled depression most of my life, quite a bit of emotional abuse in childhood mainly due to a BPD mother. I have since forgiven her. But I have not had a strong footing at any point because of non-existent self-esteem. Add in survival struggles/racism/conservative upbringing (wasn't allowed to date). I had complete inability to know how to set boundaries or say no! That meant years of overt and covert abuse from all kinds of people - sexual abuse by a friend for almost 10 years and other randos, was a narc bait, a fav choice of bullies who came in all shapes like neighbors, bosses, colleagues, friends...and even a therapist which fucked me over badly, etc. Of course, I have been suicidal too and attempted a few times after my engagement and a miscarriage happened with a guy (in retrospect, he too was a textbook narc)...I give all this not to score Sympathy Points. Please trust me. I am not trying to say I am special in any way. I know people who have struggled more than I have too. I am trying to find help so if I am going to survive, can I also thrive? How do I do that when I am not interested in anything at all? Nothing interests or excites me. Bringing in new people into my life doesn't make me trust them at all. If I am going to be screwed for the rest of my whatever life is left, then I wish to just end things again but feels like a waste after I tried so hard for so many years to find answers and overcome so much.

412,joellevp,1597347360,"So, I think it pretty common to have experienced some form of stigma due to having a mental illness. To combat that stigma, we get told that mental illness is like having any other illness, regardless of whether or not we can see a physical manifestation of symptoms. And, a common analogy that I have been exposed to is the broken leg analogy. One wouldn't ask an individual to walk on their broken leg, but ask them to rest and care for themselves. So, too, should we care for ourselves, and take the time to heal when we have a mental illness. Just because we can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there, etc. 

This has bugged me of late because we effectively are being asked to walk on the bad leg. Using the same analogy, this depression, and for me BPD, manifests in my mind, and essentially makes me believe I have a 'broken leg.' The default reaction is to indulge that thought and rest, because it makes me believe I cannot do; that my capacity for anything is small, and so I rest. I am fatigued, I have despair, etc. We all know. 

On the other side of therapy now, I have learned that this belief of a broken leg is in fact unhelpful patterns and wiring in my brain. My brain has superimposed this idea of brokenness onto what is considered healthy, so my belief, and what I see, is the brokenness. So, how do I heal? Most of it is outhinking, and out-strategising my mind and its processes. The catch though, is that I have to do that on a mind I perceive as broken (putting it simplistically). Essentially, I have to unlearn that brokenness. So, in effect, I have to walk on my broken leg in order to heal.

In New Zealand one in five adults will experience depression. As someone who has experienced depression I know that it is important to have these mental health discussions in order for those suffering to know that it is okay and that help is available to them.

For years, it has been difficult for me to explain how I got over my depression in a way that made sense to others.

Recently however, I found an excellent example: there was a 'deleted scene' song from Frozen 2 titled ""[I Wanna Get This Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3TDYioBjac)"". In it, Kristof is trying to propose to Anna and is focusing so heavily on how his proposal isn't perfect that he can't see how Anna is effectively desperate for him to propose.

Near the end of the song they have a duet where he says ""I want to be the man you want"" with her following up with ""like you already are"", and that -- is the main point.

I've had a long and complicated history with mental health, but to keep it short, a few years ago I was in a really dark place and was basically just lying in bed trying to ignore the world and my existence for almost a year. It's been a long and difficult journey but I'm at a place where I'm now mostly doing better. I'm not constantly in bed and for the most part I can muddle through. I'm not working or anything but I participate as much as I can in day to day life, and I have a good routine most of the time which really helps keeping me stable.

The issue is, whenever something bad happens, even perfectly normal day to day things (e.g. a fallout with my partner, having a stressful day, even just burning my toast sometimes), I just recede back to curling up on the couch or my bed and feeling like shit. At best I can zone it out and just turn off my feelings, but usually I just sit feeling like shit, and I can't lift myself out of it. It's so fucking upsetting and I'm so tired of it. My whole day has been just sitting about feeling shit, and I know tomorrow I'll wake up and feel like shit still. I don't even care about what bothered me any more, that's been resolved, I just feel shit cause I feel shit. And tomorrow I'll feel shit because I feel shit and also because I had a shit day today and am sad that I didn't have the good day I had planned.

How can I get myself out of these states? Please don't say ""just go for a walk"" or ""snap out of it"" or ""fake it til you make it"" cause I can't handle that shit, it just doesn't help me at all.

TW: heavy depression, suicide

I have dealt with depression a lot in the past and still deal with depressive episodes sometimes but am on a great path at the moment. I also have dealt with suicidal thoughts and self harm, but the suicidal thoughts where always quite.. theoretical? If that makes sense? When I felt very very bad I liked thinking about death and dying, and I googled lethal dosage of medicine for my body and then took a little less of it, for example. I don’t think I was ever actually in danger of dying, but flirting with the line. 


Now, one of my best friends develloped depression. I don’t know if I know everything about it of course, all I know is what she tells me and what I can see. But we knew each other for many years, 9 to be correct, and she has been getting significantly worse during the last 1.5 years. It has reached a point where I am worried she might commit suicide. I have read through many websites about how to deal with depressed and suicidal friends, but I wanted to ask here. Maybe some of you remember how friends have been the most helpful, what you wished friends did, etc. 


I hope some of you can give me some further ideas about how to help her as best as I can!
Thanks in advance!


(Medication frame of reference): 
She did start taking SSRI’s around four weeks ago, and I know they can increase suicidality in the beginning, but so far she has only gotten worse. Maybe not because of them, but they didn’t help, and the doctor said after three to four weeks she should feel positive results.

I managed to slowly get better, and simply not wishing my own death every single day was a huge victory for me. It truly got better. 
But a couple of month before the lockdown, everything went to shit again. I don't really know why, but it's like every small technique I used not to feel bad became increasingly less and less effective. And now I hate myself again. It got to the point where I had to leave my boyfriend (whom I still have feelings for) so I could focus on those crumbs of happiness I have left. This feels like a selfish decision, but I just couldn't find the time to see him. The little time I had for him, I actually had to split it between him and my friend who's recently also been going through a very challenging time mentally. 
I need to focus on my own state and I realised how this relationship wasn't healthy for either of us. He had his own problems, seeing me like that made things worst for him, and I just wasn't strong enough to explain to him why I feel this way. So this created some kind of vicious circle where my state worsened because I felt terrible and couldn't possibly begin to tell him why I feel this way, making him feel bad and me feel guilty about it. 

I will not allow myself to go back to where I was a couple of years ago. Which is why I broke up with him, so I could focus on myself. But this whole things is bugging me so bad.

I've been doing quite well recently, but sometimes fear, panic and sadness gets the best of me. A lot of big changes are about to happen in my life and it's a lot to handle sometimes. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to slip and fall.

Last night I had a headache and eventually started throwing up and was just generally feeling quite sick. Because I'm a bit unstable mentally I immediately connected that to feeling sick (my body responds heavily to my emotions. I throw up a lot when I panic or worry for example). Sometimes when this happens I start thinking about how I'm losing grip on myself and on reality and fear I'm going mad. I worry about how my mental health will only get worse and worse and how eventually I won't be able to take care of myself anymore. I worry about not finding a way out.

I'd never thought I'd be posting here since I got better and better for the last few months.

I'm diagnosed with adult adhd and depression. I got some compulsive episodes - today I mostly struggle with skin picking.
I had a strong episode of anorexia and bulimia when I was still at school, I think it was around 15-17.

Today I'm 23, thriving at university, got a loving fiancee and the best dogo you could imagine.

Two years ago I left the clinic and I got strong. I thought to be the most self sufficient, optimistic and altruistic I have ever been lately.

Five minutes ago I put new batteries into the weight scale since they were out for weeks.
I knew I didn't exercise in any way since isolation started, spending the whole day on the laptop for uni. Crap food, lots of sugar.

The scale showed I broke the mental border of 60 kgs which was my arch enemy since grade 8.

I felt the gut crunching weight of these years all because of seeing this number on the scale, telling me I gained 10kg in the last few weeks.
I felt like the strength of the last months peeled from me like an old wallpaper.

Now I'm sitting here on the porch, almost crying while I'm typing this. Unable to speak a word to my fiancee who is inside playing war zone with friends.

Self confidence was something that as a teenager I was desperately seeking, I felt that something was missing for me, that something about me was just not enough and the way I looked at “self confidence” was as something that I need to “build”, “develop” or “grow”. Today I don’t think that’s the case.

When I look at the idea of self confidence, this is what I see: The voice in our head judges us for how we are not enough “X” or not enough “Y” and for how much we need to improve and fix ourselves. We are used to believing this voice and so this belief creates a sense of not being enough, doubt in oneself and emotional pain. Out of this belief of us not being enough, plainly speaking we feel “lousy” or “like shit” as common language would say. We don’t like feeling this way and so our mind starts searching for a solution. What is the solution? Well the voice in our head loves freely telling us all the illusive standards it holds for us to be good enough for it. So the obvious solution seems to be to take action as best we can so we can measure up to the illusive standards of the voice in our head(Oh btw I’m going to save you the effort I tried and it does not work). Of course the voice in the head is very good at inventing standards and so it keeps raising the bar higher and creating more and more standards to live up to, so EVEN if we measure up to these standards it’s just going to create new ones. See, the voices job isn’t to congratulate you or support you, all it does is judge you, it’s role is to judge and it will invent any reason on top of his role to fulfill it, whether the reason “makes sense”, helps you and supports you or is realistic does not matter to this voice AT ALL. When we don’t measure up to the standards the voice goes “Oh you loser, you look ugly, you are not good enough you will never be good enough etc…”. Btw this voice is very sneaky and so often we don’t notice it and the only thing we notice is us feeling bad and “down on ourselves”(which is really not true because the voice is the one putting us down).

I like being practical so I think it’s better to solve the problem where it originates. The solution is to get that the game that the judge in our head is playing is a broken one, it has bugs, full of lags and there is no way to win it, We just have to stop playing it and transition to a new game that is much more fun. Simplified, the solution is such: Not believing the voice in the head leads to not feeling shit and to not feeling unconfident which saved us all the trouble of building “self confidence” to cover up our emotional pain in the first place! Disbelieving the voice in the head leads to a natural sense of confidence and self love. From that point of view we are free to live our lives and we don’t have to listen to an imaginary voice that is verbally beating us up anymore, even if it shows up from time to time we don’t really care because we understand it is talking pure nonsense. This leads to a natural and more authentic sense of confidence, one that is not artificially built, one that is actually humble without being meek, the same sense of confidence that is evident in young children who dare and are not afraid of being who they are.

In Spite of popular belief, we aren’t really afraid of expressing ourselves fully because of other people’s opinions, the opinion that really hurts us is the one of the judge in our head that is constantly beating us up and controlling our lives. Oh and btw that judge is imaginary! True freedom is freedom from the judge in our head, it is the realization that the judge in our head is an imaginary voice that does not exist and therefore we don’t have to believe anything this imaginary voice says! The natural consequence of not believing this imaginary voice is joy, happiness, inner acceptance and inner peace. From there life turns pretty damn fun, we don’t have to prove anything to anyone and at the same time we have many fun stuff we want to create while were alive in this body, what a joy what a joy! It is important for me to say that this sounds simple and easy but is harder than it looks and personally it took me a lot of perseverance, different practices and guidance from teachers to help me get over these voices. Today I am grateful to offer people help as well.

460,7ProxiesBitch,1591173860,"Hey y'all. I'm having a really rough day and am planning to fill a script for Citalopram tomorrow morning. I started writing and the following fell out - I guess I want to get it all off my chest before doing something I still have very mixed feelings about.  
I'm turning 27 in less than a month and was recently hit with the realisation that I've been dealing with depression and anxiety off and on, mostly on, for nearly a decade. Over these years, I've come to recognise that my depression is cyclical - I tend to have a few months of severe depression followed by a few months of relief. I've seen several counselors and had a brief stint with a psychotherapist, but only at times when I've been depressed and in need of someone to talk to; I've always stopped going not long after I start feeling better. I've been resistant to the idea of medication this whole time and have believed that my problems are things I need to arrive at a deeper understanding of through talking.  
After escaping an emotionally abusive relationship in June last year, I had one of the most joyful months of my life, followed by 5 months of the most debilitating depression I've ever experienced. Somehow, I managed to plan and go on a camping trip with a friend in early December, and ended up opening up to her about how bad things had been. She had also escaped an abusive relationship years ago and did an amazing job of holding space for me to express myself. I felt so understood by her; she listened to and affirmed me in a way I hadn't experienced with anyone else in my life.   
I woke up the next morning feeling different in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on. A few days later, I realised my depression had lifted - it was just gone, and in its place was genuine happiness and contentedness, things I hadn't truly experienced since before that relationship began. 2020 arrived, and these feelings persisted. I really felt like something deep had begun to shift within me. I noticed I was becoming more confident, had more self-esteem, and was ready to move my life in a new direction. Unsure as to exactly what I wanted to do, but determined to equip myself with knowledge and skills I could use to support others with their mental health struggles, I applied to return to university to study a Graduate Diploma in Psychology. Things got off to a great start - I was excited to go to class and felt engaged with and stimulated by what I was learning. It was all new and all difficult, but I felt up to the task; I was excited to prove to myself that I could rise to this new challenge I had taken on of my own accord.  
I'm 9 weeks into the semester, and once again, I'm phenomenally depressed, barely sleeping and struggling to keep up with classes and assignments. I'm sure the lockdown has played a role in this but at the same time, it's just the same old pattern and I feel like an idiot for expecting things to be different. At the same time, I feel like I have the capacity to do this and do it well, but fighting through depression on a daily basis is absolutely fucking exhausting.  
I reached out to my university's counseling service and ended up seeing a GP about a fortnight ago. He gave me the PHQ-9 and I scored 21, indicating severe depression. He prescribed me citalopram and told me to come back in 6 weeks.  I asked about pursing psychotherapy again and was told I could self-refer; unfortunately, I'm living off student allowance at the moment and simply don't have enough after rent, food and bills to afford it.  
So, here I am, looking at this script and realising that after a decade of dealing with this shit, I'm finally at a point where I'm actually about to try antidepressants for the first time. As I mentioned, I still have mixed feelings. I don't have any illusions that they'll fix me, but maybe they'll prove to be a helpful tool that can help me get to a place where I can finally start to repair myself. I guess there's only one way to find out.  
What I do know is that life is beautiful and I deserve to be happy. I haven't lost sight of this - it's just that right now my depression is making it impossible for me to perceive and appreciate that beauty in myself and the world around me. I know that I don't want to die - although I've fantasised about it and often have voices in my head telling me I'd be better off dead, the fact that I'm still here proves that I don't entirely believe them. I've never seriously considered suicide as solution to my pain. Some part of me knows this is temporary, that if I work hard enough and equip myself with the right tools, I can learn how to care for and love myself enough that I can live a happy, meaningful life and begin to truly help other people with their own struggles.   
Of course, part of me is terrified that I'll continue to oscillate between happiness and depression for the rest of my life, that nothing, not even medication, will help me. But somehow, the idea of taking medication and realising it works is even scarier. I've seen friends lose their personalities to medication; in their own words, the highs and lows have ""evened out"", but something's been lost in the process, and I'm terrified of the same thing happening to me. I wonder if this pattern has become such a huge part of my identity that I won't know who I am without it, without the contrast, and I won't know how to build myself into someone new. But then again, maybe that's just the depression closing doors I haven't even opened yet.

493,AChangeforBetter,1589109669,"Hi all!

I am new to Reddit and this community and wanted to say hi. I am a mental health counsellor with over 15 years experience and something I noticed while working community mental health was how hard it was for people to get general counselling. Like, you could go to a program for addiction, another for depression, and use after hours services for emergencies. There was no overlap in treatment or even consideration for it. 

I truly believe that all aspects of our lives contribute to our mental health and wellness. If you're struggling to make ends meet, you're likely not going to be a very happy person in general. If you hate your job and it's making you depressed, you're more likely to choose unhealthy alternatives as a way to cope. One always effects the other.

This is why I am developing a holistic wellness website called  [A Change for Better](https://achangeforbetter.com/) , to help bridge that gap. Coming from the understanding that all aspects of one's wellness need to be addressed in order to feel fully fulfilled in their life. 

Here's where I'd like your opinions. I am trying to make content that is relevant, accurate, and based in facts. But I also know that things change and that my ideas need to be adapted in order to accurately meet the needs of those who would benefit from this information the most. 

If you'd be willing, I'd love some opinions on either the site overall, but specifically this article about grounding techniques. These are techniques I use with my clients and I have good success, most of the time. But I'll admit these ideas aren't perfect. I'd love to know your ground techniques and how you implement them. I'd like to expand on this list every so many months to add as many ideas as possible. I know myself that sometimes when I'm really upset, the same things don't always work and I want to give people as many ideas as possible when they need it most. 

If you made it this far, thank you and sorry. LOL That was long but needed. I've been told Reddit community is a wonderful place to start for more information and so I wanted to go directly to people who would use these skills.

So i just watch the movie a few days ago on Netflix. I assume that many of you already saw it, it’s based on a Nobel prize winning mathematician named “John Nash”, about his life and struggles with schizophrenia. I heard about this movie and decided it will be a good time to see it after in one week my zen teacher Alex Mill recommended watching it and also don Miguel Ruiz(my personal favorite author) in his book that I was reading “The Voice of knowledge”. 

Apart from it being a fascinating film, perhaps a bit scary and exciting as well, there is something very very practical for our daily lives that explains the reason why the 2 people mentioned above recommended it. What John did in this movie to deal with his hallucinations from schizophrenia is a real lesson for how we could all create a healthy relationship with the voice in our head(For those who don’t want a spoiler you probably shouldn’t continue reading although I don’t think it'll ruin it much).

In the movie what John did was, instead of giving his power of faith and belief in these imaginary people his mind had hallucinated, believing they were real and that what they were saying was real, he stopped believing them and giving them his attention. He started being skeptical to the amount of realness of these illusions and not just that, what I find really the key is that he didn’t give them much importance and because of that they didn’t have much importance in his life. When he saw them, he didn’t really pay attention to them or let them stop him and slowly slowly they became quiet and started to stand in a corner not saying even uttering a word. These hallucinations didn’t disappear but they stopped bothering him and looked kind of tired and ready to give up, in this way he managed to begin functioning again as a normal human being without taking any drugs. This example is a great parallel to the voice in our head(which is why My zen teacher Alex and Don Miguel Ruiz recommended it). Like all of you I find it a challenging opponent. Most of us don’t have hallucinations but we do have a voice in our head speaking to us all the time during our daily life. The key that really helps me in my day to day life is the understanding that we don’t have to believe what it says or pay attention to it, we keep going forward with our goals and with what is important for us no matter what this voice says, with great love and respect to ourselves and others :)

anyway this voice is definitely tricky so this movie actually helped increase my awareness, I definitely recommend it, I also found it very inspiring. 

Have you watched it? let me know your experience.

I realize now that one particular problem for me is that I was a “secret eater.” I didn’t realize this until this whole Covid thing forced me home, and being home alone every day made me realize that my habits at home were really, really bad. I was excessively using services like Uber eats, buying way more for lunch than I needed, and just shoving food in my face because I was board, and not because I was hungry.

Hey friends, I want to share with you some things that help me in my daily life which I find very useful. it will be a bit long but I think that if you'll like it I will share one post like this every week. I really believe that for everyone one of us it is important to have a healthy relationship between us and our thoughts which leads to what I call a healthy relationship between us and ourselves. so here goes :)

The voice in my head/thinking: 

“I am not good enough”, “I’m a loser”, “What’s wrong with me?”. If you're anything like me or most people, these type of thoughts or self doubts go through your head every day. Or maybe you don’t experience it that way as thoughts that appear in your consciousness  and you mostly notice your emotions such as vague or even strong feelings of fear/anxiety/stress/unease or a lack of self confidence. If you only experience the emotions, it is from my experience that thoughts such as the ones I wrote before are just happening in the background(the subconscious mind and we just weren’t paying enough attention because they happen so fast that we don’t consciously notice them. 

There are 2 things I want to show  in this post:

1. We aren’t the ones who are really thinking these thoughts
2. There is a simple(not easy!) way to get out of the fear, pain and suffering that they create(and maybe see all of this as a funny misunderstanding). 

Here’s the deal, we have a voice in our head and it is alive! Most people during most of the day are identified with this voice so much that we are certain that it is us thinking all day. I totally understand this difficulty because I used to live that way and it was like living in a mental prison that you can’t get out of(Anyone watch the Matrix?). One of the biggest discoveries that begins a person’s spiritual journey(or self development/self help/self care/ or however you wish to call it journey) is the discovery that we are not our thoughts. At first, this might look scary and create an identity issue of some sort, but like spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle says(and this is my favorite quote of his: “It is a relief to know that we are not our thoughts”. Take a moment or 2 to ponder how your life would look like if you weren’t so identified with your thoughts(and if you experience inner difficulties mostly as emotion then do the same with negative emotions). What an amazing discovery! in this way, we can think and believe whatever we want, we don’t have to believe in thoughts that cast doubt on us or that judge us and others, we are free to live life the way we want to live them(yayy!). 

This simple truth that we are not our thoughts is discovered very quickly for anyone who tries meditating for even 5 minutes(or that tries not to think about a fat pink elephant right now at this moment!). When we meditate, we start the practice with the intention to put our full attention on the breath and keep it there during the practice. Oops! in exactly 5 seconds to a minute, we find out that our entire attention went away and were back to habitual thinking about when Corona will end so that we'll go eating with our friends at our favorite pizza place. People who practice meditation find out quickly that our attention, even with the best of intentions goes very quickly and habitually to thinking. and yes, our thoughts take our attention for a huge part of our time(according to science we think between 50 to 80 thousand thoughts a day).

So what is this voice in the head and what do we do with it? If we look very closely we can see that this voice in the head speaks to us in different ways at different times. It is alive and like anything that is alive it changes all the time. The voice in the head(thinking) can talk to us as a friend, a judge, a victim of life’s circumstances, as an angry person, as a complainer, as a responsible planner of our day and money expenses or as that darn voice tempting us to eat a piece of chocolate cake and break our diet commitment! Of course all of these are thoughts that we often identify ourselves as us **being** them. But let's at least just for the sake of this post “pretend” we're not them to help us see other possibilities. One thing for sure about this voice, it likes using the word “I” to disguise itself as us, to make us identify with it. But what will happen if we just stop for a moment, take a deep breath, smile and start looking at it during our day to day lives. What will happen if we ask ourselves curious questions such as: What is this voice doing? What is it saying? Wow I feel a little bit afraid right now, what is the voice saying that makes me feel that way? Wow this voice really gets angry when people don’t behave the way I expect them to(Instead of us identifying with it and saying that “we're” angry), what a fascinating voice! wow he is really scared that I will do that thing that I always dreamt of doing(Instead of us identifying as it and believing that **we're** the ones afraid). This way, step by step we break our identification with this voice and our relationship with it where we believe everything it says, a relationship in which we have no free choice to do what we want because **it** tells us what to do. In this approach of observing the voice an amazing thing happens, instead of us identifying with it or believing it and living under it’s terror, we look at the voice as a curious scientist(think of jane godwin observing monkeys in the wild).

When we develop such a relationship with the voice in our head, it stops being in control of our lives and becomes an interesting(although not always nice) companion, and this voice starts to seem really really funny. Step by step, it starts getting tired and even quiets down. But anyway it isn’t that important because when we develop such a relationship with the voice in our head, it doesn't matter if it's quiet or not, were free to take the reins back over our lives, we don’t have to believe it any longer :)

Hey friends how are you I’m Daniel, I sometimes post here to offer support or share a video I made but I realized you don’t really know much about me. If you don’t know much about me, how can you trust my advice or my opinion. I know that when I was in the midst of depression’s grip, I would be very careful about trusting what people say, fearing advice that would only result in more suffering for me. I realize also that if I were to hear about other people recovering from their depression, it may inspire me but it also may make me feel hopeless about how they did it but I still did not. I want to make this post in the hopes of you getting to me better(and me getting to know you in the comments please :) ).

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR BELOW**

What I want to share in this post is my own personal journey, my aim is to be as transparent as possible and just present a fellow human’s journey through the suffering grip of depression and how I helped myself to end it(I will also share some of what helped me). 

Ending depression is not really something you could put a line in the sand on and go “Oh, OK, today I am officially not depressed”. Rather, it is more a deepening of well being where before there was intense pain. 

Back in around August of 2016, I fell very quickly into what I guess can be called as deep pain and inner darkness(later diagnosed as depression basically). It was like dark clouds appeared and covered the vast, open sky of my mind and hid away the warmness of life and the sun(tried a literature like metaphor lol). Very quickly, I felt like all remnants of joy were sucked out of me. only pain, deep depressive sadness and a lack of aliveness and connection with life were present. At first, I had no idea why this was happening and why was I feeling this way, this made it even worse as I struggled trying to find meaning to this emotional mess. Googling tips on how to deal with this intense depressive episode I had did not yield similar results to googling a “how to cook a chocolate cake recipe”. Instead, I ended up feeling worse and hopeless. nowhere I looked back then, did it seem there is a clear step by step “Chocolate cake recipe” solution to depression(I really like chocolate), although I really wanted one. A week at this intense state of suffering and I decided to tell my parents I need a therapist because I could not handle this anymore.

Excitement and hope arose as I spoke to my therapist for the first time, he was very kind and warm and he turned out to be a big key in my recovery. Although I felt intense, I had a really hard time opening up to him. At that time, I was crying all day, I had no energy to do anything and everything I used to like and that seemed fun just did not do it for me anymore. In Spite of  that, I acted like everything was Ok with me. My therapist knew it wasn’t I bet, but we were just talking and was very kind. He taught me meditation, how to observe my thoughts and how to be with painfuls emotions.

What I didn’t tell him and was afraid to share was that there was a voice in my head constantly cursing me, urging me to do awful things and telling me how much he hates him. While everything on the surface seemed ok, I was afraid to talk to him about this voice and **it** was the real problem that was not getting addressed. It was like having a dictator live in my head, a very unstable Kim Jong Un type of fella who is constantly talking to me. All of that mess and also the last time I heard of people having voices in their head, it was crazy people in movies, people like the Harley Quinn type have voices in their heads, the one that end up in crazy people asylums. That brought about intense fear that I myself may be crazy. I later found out it is extremely normal([https://pathwaytohappiness.com/voices-in-your-head/](https://pathwaytohappiness.com/voices-in-your-head/)) to have voices in your head talking to you. 

It is so normal to have voices in your head that in fact everybody has one. most people think it’s them doing the thinking and are identified as the voice, for that reason they don’t notice that. I on the other hand, had the fortune of having such a crazy voice that there was no way it was me, I was just a normal teenager growing up with a normal loving and supportive family, this voice was completely insane, this voice in fact constantly tried to tell me that he is me. I was literally noticing thoughts saying “I am you”. Well, if he was me, then how the hell can he/she/it say: “I am you”? that is impossible. 

despite that, I was very afraid of it, I was very afraid of what he will say and what will he tell me to do, what I did not realize at the time is that voice has no power, he is as the common saying about certain dogs: “All bite and no bark”. That voice can’t actually do anything but talk talk talk and create some emotions. The more I noticed this voice, the more I started getting angry at him, my approach shifted to fighting him and trying to tell him to go away. This did not work either, that is because it just seemed to make him be stronger **and** I was also exhausted from constant inner fighting with him for power over my thoughts. As part of my ongoing therapy, my therapist told me to just let the voice be, there is no need to fight him, just to not listen to him, he helped me see that the voice has no actually power over my life unless I give it to him, In fact I was the source of power and he was all talk and no walk. He could not actually make me believe what he says or make me do anything he says, he is talking and I can listen, but I don’t have to believe a word(this is a nice video showing how this works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z29ptSuoWRc&amp;t=20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z29ptSuoWRc&amp;t=20s)). This is the essence of meditation practice, you bring yourself back to the breath, you take dominion over your attention and every time it goes to the voices, you bring it right back to your breath. Meditation is an active practice of not believing what the voices in your head say and it was a big part of my journey out of depression.

As time went by, more and more was I reading inspiring books, articles and YouTube videos, more and more I was practicing meditation and other helpful techniques that help me believe the voices in my head less and less and give them less control over my life, as well as being able to ride emotional waves of pain I had accumulated. With time, I gradually noticed improvement, again and again, Continually seeing how I am more and more free and how emotionally I feel lighter, the most important part was noticing how this voice has less and less control over 

my life as I am realizing my attachments to beliefs it holds in my mind. 

One of the most helpful tools was getting a Good therapist, to me a good therapist is one who is unconditionally loving and accepting but one that is also aware of that voice in your head (Most people, therapist or not are still identified with it) and one that will show you how it works and how to not believe it. One of the biggest tools were the self mastery courses on my mentor’s website: [https://pathwaytohappiness.com/courses/](https://pathwaytohappiness.com/courses/). These courses are life changing stuff. Other tools were all books by: Don miguel ruiz, Don miguel ruiz jr., Eckhart tolle, Alex Mill(Alex Mill’s online course is also amazing if you have the money). Also, Eckhart tolle’s youtube channel is great and the podcasts of Jack kornfield and Don miguel ruiz Jr.  These are what helped me most.

One day, I just took a look back about a year after that dark episode, there was still a lot of suffering and uncovering to be made, but I clearly saw that I was out of depression. Since then, I have been practicing more and more to free myself from the cages of beliefs in my head and to be able to live life from truth, happiness and love, just as I had dreamed of doing all that time when I was depressed. 

**TLDR: I suffered from crippling depression, I was crying all day and considering suicide very often. I found ways I truly believe in to take our power, happiness and inner peace back and I have a lot of faith in how these ways can help others.  2 Paragraphs about I shared some  of them, I also wanted to get to know you all better and you to know me better so that maybe you value what I share better. and Last but no least(More on that below), I wanted to ask you what videos I can create that can help you, what challenges are arising etc..**

What I want is no less than to help more people make this journey because I believe and know with all my heart that it is possible for everybody here and it is our birthright to enjoy our lives. So I wanted to share this to maybe offer some hope and also let me get to know you better so that perhaps if you see that I post something you may consider to better value what I share and maybe giving it a shot.

Since it is a really big heartfelt passion of mine to help others make the journey I have made(and this practice is ongoing), I wanted to ask you if you can take the time to share with me what types of help or topics can I make videos or posts about that will help you the most. For example - videos about challenges with depression(you can offer specific challenges that come up), videos about handling emotions, videos about detaching from negative beliefs and the voice in our head, handling certain thoughts or urges, me talking about practices that helped me, meditation videos designed specifically for depression etc… 

If you read even a part of this I really really thank you and hope it helped in some way. I wish for all of  you a quiet evening :)","My story and how I recovered from crippling depression(Long post, wanting to share in the hopes it will help)",1587828497.0

527,GeneralWalters421,1586141751,"So basically university went completely online during the pandemic (I’m in first year and am an 18M), meaning I could go back to my Mum and Brother in New Zealand. (My parents divorced a while ago meaning my Dad lives in Canada while my Mum and now my Brother live in NZ). 

Back before university closed I was in one of the worst worst spats of depression I have ever been in my life. I was honestly at points seriously considering suicide. I’m better now, don’t worry, just explaining the gravity of the situation. I’ve been depressed for a long time, probably ever since my parents divorced which forced me to move across the world a bunch during middle school. I lost all my childhood friends thanks to this and ever since I have honestly not had one consistent friend. I’ve made a bunch of acquaintances, as I’m not socially inept or super introverted or anything. It’s almost if I just don’t have much interest myself plus don’t really understand relationships. Being autistic doesn’t help. 

Anyway, university seemed to actually be getting better. I certainly enjoyed the academic life much more than high school. I also made a friend with this girl in my class. Lets call her Izzy. Izzy is super socially awkward and introverted, shes also super nerdy. I really liked Izzy as a friend, but kind of fell for her as well. Things got super complicated though. Izzy is 21 whilst I’m 17 at the time. I kind of make it apparent I like her accidentally and tells me shes not interested in me or getting a boyfriend in general. Despite her age shes never dated before. I tried to accept this though, I continued to just try to be friends and thats what I thought I wanted but to tell the truth I was still confused about my feelings. Eventually things kind of fell apart and I fell back into a period of depression. At the time I felt incredibly lonely. I had no friends and I felt like my family did not care for me. As a result of this I kind of put a lot of my depression on Izzy and explained my situation with a bit tmi. Things got so complicated that she basically told me to leave her alone because I was making her quite anxious. 

This is also when the cornavirus also hit. University closing gave me the ability to go back to New Zealand where my Mum lives and would be able to help me better than my Dad. During this time before leaving I also talked to Izzy again and things mostly recovered. After a long and difficult flight during a global pandemic I made it to NZ just before a stage 4 alert was declared, forcing everyone indoors and all borders were closed. Because I arrived from Canada I had to go into self isolation for a few weeks, however my Brother was allowed to self-isolate with me. My Mum rents out some homes and she secured one of them which is a beach front house. She also dropped off her two dogs to keep me company. So all things considered, I have it very good. I get to walk two cute dogs on the beach everyday and play video games with my Brother. During this time I recovered from the severe depression I was in before, however for some reason I still feel unsatisfied.

For starters, Izzy has not really texted me at all or anything. She views what I see on instagram and I texted her about her dogs a few times which she replied to. However, either shes just very introverted (which is possible and I don’t blame her), or she just doesn’t like me very much anymore because of everything. I’m not saying she hates me, I just don’t think she cares much about me anymore, which sucks since we do have a lot in common and I still like her. To tell the truth, I still have feelings for her. I used to think I was lonely because I had no friends and nobody to talk to, but I have my family, and with friends, a lot of people have tried to be my friend, but I honestly felt apathetic about it most of the time. Even people who shared all my interests, I just kind of stoped talking to a lot of the time, and I don’t even know why. I feel lonely, but I don’t care about having friends. I thought I wanted to date, so I tried online dating a bit, but also just didn’t care much. Possibly because I still liked Izzy. I don’t know, I feel mostly content and cheerful, but I also have no ambition or interest in much things. I don’t even know if I want to go back into university, yet at the same time I don’t really want to do much else. I also still feel very down a lot of the time. 

I feel selfish for feeling this way though... Being depressed because “no gf” feels so pathetic. I don’t know though, I don’t even know what I want. Maybe I should seek counselling? I have done this before but I never stuck with one because it never seemed to help much. I understand this is a super long and incoherent rant but advice would really help.

TL;DR Had depression last year and feeling much better now, but some days are still so bad I get really scared and I wonder if someone has any advise? 

Bit of a back story. So I (27F) had a depressive episode last year with its peak exactly a year ago. Was depressed as a young child, felt great as a teenager and young adult but slowly started to get depressed again at 25/26. The peak came after I got really ill with pneumonia abroad, my relationship failed and I went off hormonal birth control. It was really bad, I couldn’t even put my own clothes on an thought/ planned suicide. I went to see my GP, got a spot with a psychologist a few months later (bit too late but ok), did a LOT of reading on my own, tried very hard to get better, without medication (I really saw/ see this as a last resort for me, not many good stories around me with it unfortunately). I got better, a lot better. I went on a 6 week long holiday to Italy, in a tiny village in nature. I quit my job, finished my 2 masters on my last energy and was/am really proud. I fell in love with an amazing guy, a bit of struggles to get it going but he’s honestly the best boyfriend, partner and friend now. The good and the bad, he’s here for it. I am really thankful I was in the position to do all this with lots of help from friends, family and my new partner. 

Some days, or parts of the day, I still feel extremely bad. Maybe 1 day a week/ every 2 weeks. It’s like I’m back to how I felt a year ago all over again. It’s like the worst night terror. Like sleep paralysis if you’ve even had that. A black hole inside of me. In that moment I think everything will go wrong, no money, my bf will leave me like the last one, someone WILL die etc. It will all come back and never go away. I can’t seem to figure out what triggers it.. This morning it happened again. But I got great news yesterday! (Has a great job interview in the middle of this pandemic..!) But when I woke up I felt so bad I want to just be dead. After a long talk with the bf I snapped out of it eventually.

My question is: what can I do at this point, if anything? More therapy? (Tbh it didn’t really work that well for me, not bad, just not... great) Try medication anyway? Do I have anxiety and not depression at this point? I’m pretty desperate because although it’s only a day, or a few hours, in these moments I’d rather truly be dead. I’m lucky I survived last year.

I’ve gone from being a bedroom dwelling, disgusting human being to achieving. So many things. 

I landed a new job, in a new town. Moved out finally (I’m 22). Started college and have been achieving really food grades. I started hitting the gym daily and pushing myself to my breaking point every fucking day. 

But last night I had a panic attack spurred by a joke made by my flatmate. Simply calling me gay for not having a relationship. I’m not gay, I just have a long distance relationship I’ve hidden from those around me due to their judgemental natures. 

And I don’t even know why it dug that hard, but it did. I’m madly in love with this person I met, but the domino effect has happened and I’m struggling to contain it. 

I can’t just relax and play some games, without judgement. I feel like I live in a very toxic household where certain things are frowned upon, yet others completely “the norm”. Every little thing I do “wrong” is picked up and torn apart. It’s beneficial because I’ve been trying to improve, but I don’t know if I can take it when my dominos are falling. 

I just had a stupid break down to my partner about my teeth. I have bad teeth, my parents never enforced any routine, and never took me to dentists. Now I’m saving to fix them, but they make me so insecure, and despite looking past them for so long, all these little things are clawing at me, and I am presenting myself as weak, exactly what happened with my ex and she ran off cheating and gaslighting me the moment I did. I know it’s wrong to think she will do this (she’s so much better) but it’s examples like this that are happening. 

That and my uni is running my courses SO WEIRD with lockdown. My course is having a shorter break and we have not organised fuck all. We didn’t even have our teachers get online for classes today, assignment dates have changed but we don’t k ow when. 

And to top it off I just want to sit outside and vape (or even better, have a smoke, but I quit those and I’m close to quitting the vape) but it’s pissing down rain. 

How do I break this cycle before it snowballs and I end up where I was? I want to just be left alone, but I know that’s where it starts with me. I recluse and it all goes downhill.

554,RedBlueFlora,1584835832,"Hello.

I am in quarantine since February. I give birth to a lovely baby that was premature and chose to self-isolate for the time being due to Covid19 and other possible flu/virus. 

I am doing little things to avoid the ""depression"" state of mind that I used to fall for. I am still in therapy, online sessions now, and doing better every day. So, here my tips during this stressful and negative period.

I don't wear sweatpants or gym stuff anymore. My pyjamas are for the night. Every morning I try to take a shower and change in more ""work"" clothes as possible. My body is sore, but I have few nice shirt dress with buttons and warm leggings and old cardigans. Even if I stay inside all the time, the routine of putting ""outside"" clothing makes me more ""productive"" or at least more aware of the time passing. At sunset, I change to my night clothes. 

I watch the world outside in silence. I usually rocking the baby. The bedroom windows are facing the street, I watch people walk their dog or shopping, and I make happy stories about them in my mind. It sounds silly, but help me with my negative thoughts.

I eat less and drink water more. It seems easy to fall into the chips/cake trap. I eat breakfast and dinner, lunch is often forgotten or just a green smoothies. I drink a lot of water, hot in the morning, colder in the afternoon. I put fruits in it too. At the beginning it was uncomfortable, now it is not.

I plan what I want to watch every 2/3 days. I usually can't do it every day. I sleep when the baby sleeps too, especially during the day. Breast pumping makes me sleepy too. But having a list of things I want to watch instead of scrolling for hours makes my life more simple and avoid that empty moment where we can feel the depression coming back. It can be a youtube video or a full tv shows. 

Gratitude/Praying. It's a more personal moment and since having the baby, I feel more comfortable of having a moment to be grateful for what I have. I repeat the list of nice events/things I have right now, from the basic (my son, food, a roof) to a much more personal or complicated one. I am not religious but I do believe it, so maybe for me it's easier.

Well, that's me. What about you?",Little things I do during quarantine,1584835832.0

[long read but worth it in my opinion]

I was officially diagnosed with severe “manifested” depression summer of 2019. I’ve dealt with a lot of trauma throughout my life, death, multiple types of abuse, drug addiction, etc, which I think is what caused my depression to manifest and eventually build overtime. I had a severe self harm habit which was discovered by my doctor when I went to consult him
about a medical issue that had gained my attention. (Turns out it was anxiety attacks.) While talking, he asked to see my arms to make sure I wasn’t self harming. There were scars and marks going back to sixth grade, all the way until a day or two before this appointment. I broke down, and one thing led to another, I was prescribed sertraline and sent to a therapist. My dad hasn’t been very supportive of me which has been tough, but I learned to lean on the people who were there for me, such as myself and my therapist. I managed to keep my eating problems to myself and told my therapist that I was doing better and that my medication was helping. So by and by and stopped going to see him, and I genuinely felt okay until school began. Once school began though, I got into a really rough depressive slump. I wasn’t eating, I wasn’t going to class, I was occasionally self harming, my room was disgusting, I had no motivation. But one day I got lucky and met my now boyfriend. Being with him made me realize I could never fully love him if I wasn’t okay with who I was, so one weekend I took the first step to my recovery and wrote down all of my mental and physical health goals. My next step was to take a weekend and clean my entire room. It was exhausting, and I wanted to give up, but I powered through it. My next step was getting caught up with my classes, which has been the hardest thing so far. But I managed it, and passed all my classes. I am very very proud of myself for that. There are more steps, but I practiced better hygiene, I trained my brain to think positively when I want to do the opposite, I began to eat better and more, I started going to the gym. Slowly I started to gain my motivation back, I rediscovered my passion for reading and music, and now I can say I’m finally happy with where I am. I do go through slumps, but I know my boyfriend will be there for me if I ever need him. Im currently 177 days clean, my room has been neat for five months straight, I’m doing amazing in my classes, and I’ve stopped taking my medication. 
This has been an extremely difficult, painful and trying journey, but also the most rewarding, enlightening and strengthening journey.

In this thread, we would love for you to share how you are staying on the road to recovery with the disruption you are facing from COVID-19. Please feel free to tell us what you have been doing to keep your mind occupied and healthy. 

We would also like to repeat what we talked about in our thread titled *General Advice - The First Steps.* 

&gt;**Two: Screen-time and Sunshine.**

&gt;One of the major steps you can make to regain control of yourself is to increase sunshine and decrease screen-time. Take up a hobby, it could be anything as long it gets you out of your bedroom and away from your screen. Hobbies cost money and that may be a problem but an hour-long walk during the day is free and is a great way to get out of your house.

&gt;You may also want to start changing the things on your screen. Avoid online communities that allow your depression to fester(more in the 'People' section). Focus on things online that are productive or at least positive - Stay away from memes that normalize or celebrate your depression. /r/CasualConversation is great and so is - as cheesy as it may be - /r/wholesomememes/.

^ This has become harder to do with the COVID-19 outbreak but the simple pleasure of a walk or bike ride is still possible. It is also, now more than ever, important to keep in mind what is on your screen.

Discuss and ask questions about all things regarding to recovering in social isolation.

561,AirBreather5000,1584404203,"I got into yoga and it has really changed a lot for me. Also started reading a lot of psychology related books. 

Therapy has also helped tremendously, but i'm going to leave that out of here, because I want to focus on the work that we ourselves are responsible for, even when in therapy.

With depression and anxiety you get all sorts of symptoms that interfere with your life; Fatigue, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, panic attacks, etc. I'm sure you all can list plenty more things. 

I just want to say that yoga was interesting because it helped me address the cognitive and the physical symptoms at the same time. We carry a lot of tension in our bodies and our thoughts can go in loops all on their own. Getting into yoga has helped me make space in my mind, and literally in my body. 

Not only does showing up to the class help, but having gone for about a year now (3-6x a week) I've learned HOW to get to a more centered state of mind. In CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), developing the skill of becoming the observer is significant. Attending yoga classes in person provided me with an environment in which to practice and hone this skill. 

In doing so I've been able to notice what's going on without allowing that urge to constantly correct, or feel guilty, to overtake my behavior, and further compromise my thinking.  

In reading the books, for one, I have always been interested in the subject. This one may not be for everyone, but if you have the time, there are some fantastic resources available to you (I'll list some). 

As adults, it IS our responsibility to address and repair our mental health, but it's easy to miss or misinterpret things, even if it's our own mind we're talking about. 

I'm tempted to get into detail but it'd be better for me to just recommend some of the books I found useful.

I grew up im small place, with supportive and conservative parents and family. I was the good kid to my parents growing up. Did everything right. Had perfect life in high school until my 18th birthday. Girlfriend, friends, grades, health - everything right on place. Then i moved out and went to university and everything was ok for first two years, then the hell started. First i ended long term relationship, i got into bad group of people, i wasnt sleeping good because of stress. And then i got my first panic attack and everything went to hell. I got anxiet and pnic attacks everyday whole day. But i managed to live my life normaly from 19-22 despite the debilitating illnes and all that physical and mental symptoms. I overcame all that only with CBT therapy. But, Then suddenly i got tired, my intrusive thoughts flaired up(my diagnose is also ocd), and i literally felt myself shutting down. I started doubtimg my sexuality because of my i trusive thoughts(i wrote one post about this), my libido disapperaed, my emotions disappeared, completely numb. I felt so for 2 years. My depression got worse and worse, then i met one girl when i was drunk and i felt something more, more positive and i felt how bad i was, how deep was the hole i got into. I decided to visit doctor and i got prescribed medicine for first time in my life. Im almost one month on it and im not cured. But im closest to that wht i was feeling when i was normal. 
But one important thing is that i think we that suffered long time forgot how is to feel good to be happy. I actually refuse good things many tomes because i feel i dont deserve it or i can handle it. I need to learn as we all need to to be good to ourselves. I now still have that sexual problems, maybe mild erectile dysfunction. I will visit urologist for it but i think maybe sometimes its getting better im still fighting to stay with that girl despite all odds. I hope i can be happy in my life and with her in my life. I want to have opportinity to feel normal. I want to finish my univirsity soon and be happy about it. I want to love, to be able to feel it. I want you all that.

I considered myself to be in full recovery from depression as of like a year ago, when my therapist decided to discharge me because I was doing so well.

I finally moved out of my very abusive and toxic parents house last June. Since then, the things they never taught me how to do are popping up as problems. They used to make fun of me and criticize me for not knowing how to budget and cook, but I was so depressed those things didn't matter anyway. (I have been no-contact from my parents since November). Now, I live alone and my ""happiness"" is slipping. Idk how to cook. Idk how to manage money. My boyfriend is desperately trying to help me which makes me feel guilty and stupid.

Yesterday I used my new rice cooker for the first time. I was so excited to make something that would actually taste good. I followed the recipe. It tasted bland and gross and I could not finish it. This probably seems super trivial but it made me very sad and upset. I have no life skills. I wound up throwing out most of what I made because it was difficult to eat from tasting bad. Throwing out my food I was excited for made me feel worse.

My boyfriend says learning how to cook takes time, trial, and error. All my life I gave up on things I was not immediately good at. I was encouraged to be that way by my mom. But I need to eat...

When we met and were just regular friends I wasn’t like this. Even though I always (think?) i have some sort of depression I always kept a handle on it. We also weren’t that close so he didn’t see my “ugly face side”. For most part I had my shit together, when we were dating before getting into a relationship I felt happy 90% of the time. 

But then I moved abroad, went into an unfamiliar environment, everything didn’t turn out the way I expected it to be. I sunk deep, and became super clingy and kept crying all the time (Everyday). Worst of all because of my selfishness and to make myself feel better, I did things my SO didn’t approve of, I was essentially a bad and unsafe partner

Now I moved home. But I don’t necessarily feel better. Because I’m scarred from my previous experiences. Lack of social support when I left and came back. I feel physically sick most of the time, nausea and poor appetite. 

I still try to upkeep myself in terms of keeping up with working out, sleeping well, seeing a counsellor. But I still feel stressed out easily by external factors and spiral into self blaming easily. When happy stuff happens for my SO I should feel happy for him but I keep spiraling into negative patterns instead and it manifests into negative talk and negative vibes when we hangout. I hate this. I want to be better. I want to go back to a normal person like how I was when I mostly was when we were dating. 

All this depressive things seeps into other areas of my life too. I have anxiety and negative vibes. Reaching Out to new people is intimidating.

Luckily I still have a few friends who actively try to reach out to me. But I lost the closeness with the friends who dont try and I didn’t try to reach out either. If i try to reach out and I get a vibe that I’m unwelcome I feel affected by it and don’t try anymore

Even so, interacting with them Is not always easy for me. The 2 ppl that actively reach out to me are attached happily. One of them is engaged. When I talk to them sometimes I feel so disheartened by the state of my own life and relationship. And here goes the spiral again

Despite most stuff that didn’t turn out my way I’m glad I still have my SO despite being a shit partner. He still checks in regularly with me and asks how am I.

   My parents won’t accept that I haven’t been feeling okay. I’m not very open with them about any of this. They think that there’s no way that I could ever be depressed, that I’m just a kid who’s living the best life possible in America (they were refugees from a war-torn country). And I think that they’d be right, I haven’t been through trauma or hardship. But something is wrong with me. Maybe it’s because I grew up in a family where weight and body size matter more than they should and those cruel remarks and expectations led me to vomiting to lose weight and only eating 600 calories a day. Maybe it’s because I have perfectionist standards that are hard to live up to.
   Anyway, I have these periods of time that last for about a month when everything goes to [insert euphemism for opposite of heaven] and it takes everything in me to stop myself from cutting or trying to commit suicide. Then, 2 months go by, and I think that I’m okay, and it happens again.
   May 2018. I was at a low point. I held my hands over my throat and tried to do it. I had prepared countless letters, some shorter, some longer, written down who I wanted to give my belongings to on a piece of paper, and countless apologies in a notebook that I left in a pile on my desk for my parents to find in the morning. 
    But I didn’t do it right. I’m so glad that I didn’t do it right. I lost my voice, but not my life.
  I went down again in August. And I said to myself, I don’t think I’ll make it. By the end of next school year, I’ll probably be dead.
    But I didn’t try again. I made it. The [insert euphemism for opposite of heaven] in my head was louder than ever, yet I was still alive and fighting.

However, my parents got into a big argument, and so I had to move to more of a low level of education I was used to. This school was learning their multiplication skills and whatnot, when I had already been taught this, the year before. I wanted to move up a grade, but was unable to, since my mother believed I wouldn’t do well. In that school I moved to, I had straight A’s and was always exemplary. That next year, I moved back to the original school I was in, and boy, did I fall behind. I didn’t know the material, I missed key concepts from that year of which they had taught, and so I began to suffer, majorly.

My biggest problem in school these days would be mathematics. I don’t believe I’ve ever had a “math brain” but if I did, it was before I had moved schools. I struggled a lot in math later on, especially with the key concepts I had missed, but no one really thought to teach me how to do the things I needed to learn, so I never officially learned. Moving from school to school had really messed up my education mindset, and has affected me down the road.

I would like to say, that I have become more motivated in highschool to do better. My freshman GPA was not a good starter for my sophomore year, as it was a 2.75. I knew at the beginning of this year, I could do better. During the summer I had moved states and I did have to switch schools, but I knew that if I tried hard enough I would do better and be a better student.

I have joined the drama club, and we have an upcoming musical. I’ve noticed that I cannot get behind on my work or it will nip me in my butt. I have noticed that my grades are actually doing so much better than when I wasn’t apart of drama. The beginning, or first semester I ended with a 3.0 GPA, but right now in the middle of my second semester, I have gotten a 3.4 GPA, and I have never been so proud of myself before. I’ve shown such academic work ethic, and I have shown determination. It’s very tiring some days to continue on being motivated and want this for myself, but I have to remind myself that if I want to succeed later on in this world, that I need to do good now, and amazing later on.

It’s not only questioning why things make me happy but what’s the point in being happy? Two weeks ago or so I was living a normal life and I swear I didn’t have enough time in the day to do all I wanted. I’m doing very well at a good college with lots of friends good grades and having fun, I have a wonderful and supportive girlfriend who I love and great family. I’ve been stressed before but this is different. I use to stress about things like school and stuff like that, but recently I felt stressed when nothing was going on. And the typical things I would do to relieve the stress like video games or hang out with friends and watching tv didn’t really help. It then progresses to me thinking well these things don’t make me happy even though this is what I love to do, and now it seems like I can’t enjoy anything without thinking does this make me happy? Why do I care if it does? Because what’s the point of being happy? I guess I have a feeling of meaninglessness and it’s just so constant and seems like it’ll be forever. I’m meeting with a therapist this week and I’m hopeful but I’m skeptical. I just want to know if this is manageable? I’m religious and I’ve seen what suicide does to those around so that’s ruled out, but I fear the day I start to think it’s not because I often wish I wasn’t alive.

I’ll have good nights where I think I’m doing better and forget that I’m upset but then when I go to bed and wake in the morning that’s the hardest. I wake up with this feeling of everlasting dread and if I was feeling better it just resets.

&amp;#x200B;

Am looking to see if anyone else had similar experience and what strategies were used to overcome?

My current depressive episode is over 3 years - triggered by an assault at work, and complicated by employment dispute as a result (failed!) - have changed career plans as a result and also 3m ago changed antidepressant from venlafaxine which was hard work. I've had talking therapies/EMDR - always scope for more.

I'm in UK and sadly mental health is not well funded so i'm having to accept there isn't quite the support there maybe \*should\* be and practice more self care. 

For past month I've been exercising daily, getting back into hobbies (I'm a musician) and socialising more where i can - unsurprisingly i find this \*really\* hard work and some days i can feel very fed up and, well - depressed - and it can be hard work to keep positive. I joined an evening class for my music and it#s good - but some evenings there i can find it hard to be present and can be a bit space cadet ish.

I'm trying to find the sweet spot between working against the resistance and not overdoing it so i'm punishing myself. Or that sweet spot between acceptance of how things are but optimisation that they can get better?

I've a good husband (I'm gay btw)- he's not had depression, so it can be tricky to explain how it feels and I also don't want to put a downer on hi. I'm quite isolated being late 40s no children and friends drift when you're in the depths of depression. 

Do/did other people find the early stages hard work? Was it hard to find the balance? Any strategies that helped?

Did it take a while for moods to improve once you started self help? What kept you going?

I even want to go back to work and I'm applying! I recently even got back from a freelance gig about a week ago. I know I've been lucky with not having to work through the worst of my depression. 

I've slowly been working out more and taking photos (no surprise with my name and all), but the real thing that made it clear that I was feeling better? 

Getting my septum pierced. This seems silly, I know, but hear me out.  

I'm painfully quiet and 'shy' so expressing myself has always been difficult. I cared what people thought and one of my big problems was being a people pleaser. I'm still working on this. I also have body dysmorphia so I am really mean to myself about my appearance. I'm also working on this. 

However, for the longest time, I wanted my septum pierced. I was scared for a long time about what people would think and if I'd get a job, but I just went for it one day. My husband went with me and I picked out this cute piece with opals stones in it. The piercer was kind and I wish I would've brought my camera to take a photo of him. It didn't hurt and it only freaked out my husband since a big needle was in my nose. When it was done, I looked at myself in the mirror and did what my husband calls, ""my happy dance"". The piercer even chuckled. 

This was about two weeks ago I think. Whenever I'm feeling like I'm sinking, I look at that piercing and think, ""I did that. I can still keep going. I am moving."" 

My husband and family say since I got it, I seem more comfortable in my skin and happier. So my husband's been dubbing it the ""magical"" septum ring. 

I know getting piercings and tattoos can't fix depression. It just, to me, felt like a huge post that said I am changing and I am changing for the better. It was a way of me saying, ""I am getting better"". I don't know, I hope that helps.

     - Electricity,  I don't have to collect and chop wood to stay warm and get a cheap light source at night.  The cool thing is its versatile, and transfers energy into screen time of my choosing.

I don't want like ""sickly sweet everything is perfect"" kind of music, but I'm getting real sick of the ""everything is awful there's no hope"" kind of stuff. I'm okay with potentially sad topics, but more in the context of doing something about it. I also just like fun stuff with cool tunes. I don't like music without lyrics and I prefer that the lyrics have some sort of uniqueness or meaning to them. Some of my favorites right now are: 

Outlaws - Delta Rae
If We Have Each Other - Alec Benjamin
Piano Man - Billy Joel

So yeah pretty big variation but it's normally more about the message to me lol I also really enjoy musical theatre/fantasy stuff so that's possible.

Any suggestions? Even ones that don't really fit my criteria but could be good for people who are recovering? Thanks! 💙",New Music?,1579650627.0

But I also just could not eat. Food was overwhelming. I struggled to get above 700-900 calories a day and was terrified that I'd destroyed my body. 

Four weeks later, I'm consistently in the 1100-1400cal range, have so much more energy, am not cold all the time, and am gradually working my way up to maintenance calories (and enjoying being able to exercise again without feeling like I'm about to pass out.) Plus, I even almost enjoy food again. Almost. 

At my lowest point, I hadn't been able to force myself to eat anything in almost five days and had just accepted I was going to die. 

Now, I'm pretty sure that's not the case.",Progress: probably not gonna die??,1579611734.0
647,elderberry520,1579527012,"Today I saw something on Twitter that shows you the yearly progress. Now we're 5% into the year and that's tooooo fast.

2019 was not exactly my year. I was working a dead-end job that was understaffed. I didn't eat healthy, basically very little breakfast, very heavy lunch and messed up dinner. On top of that, I was renting outside at the expensive city center but the environment was (and still is) totally horrible. I had multiple suicidal episodes although I did not drag myself to the hospital for official diagnosis. Almost convinced myself to do the act a few times.

But in 2019 I also learned to draw my boundaries. I firmed told off my (Asian) parents who wanted to control my life, including what I wear and what time I come home. It was shitty, a lot of fights and emotional manipulation but I emerged winning. I stopped entertaining one of my ex-best friend, who is only using me as an emotional trashcan despite saying that she ""loves"" me all the time. I promptly cut contact with a guy, who led me on for almost a year. And I found my current partner through dating app.

Which brings us to the topic of adventure. I tried a dating app that has a bad reputation, but ended up with a good guy. I tried out new things that used to cause anxiety, like driving in the city. A big part of it was asking my parents to shut up instead of panicking in the car. I quit my job without something lined up as I wasn't able to properly prepare for interviews at my old job. (Quitting was a result of a few months' of inner-debate because all the ""experts"" out there advocated against it) I was prepared for more than 6 months of unemployment but landed a new one within 2 months. Every time I venture out of my comfort zone, I end up getting so much more back in return. Especially self-confidence.

2020. I am eating a lot more veggies and nice breakfast. I am working a tiring job that is actually rewarding. I sleep on time, mostly because my job is mentally taxing. So far everything's been good, but I usually like to be mentally prepared with worst-case scenarios. I'm working on anger management and dealing with controlling, emotional and nagging Asian parents.

I have accepted that I should let things flow instead of worrying that I am not at where I should be at 25. I just need to be better than yesterday. And I promised myself that if I ever fall into another episode, I will seek treatment for myself. Most of the time I feel like it's pure luck that my 2020 is smooth-sailing. However, I also acknowledge that I have actively made changes in 2019 that built the foundation for the better things that are coming. I journal because sometimes there are things that you can't confide in anyone, or a fleeting moment of distress. I focus on people and things that bring me joy. Those who bring me down are not meant to be in my life. Not giving a f\*\*\* is refreshing.

I guess I want attention. I don’t have a lot of friends. I only talk to like 3 people who I really trust. It’s been so hard for me to deal with my loneliness. I’ve been sexually abused and severely bullied and I think that might affect how I handle relationships. It hurts me to see my friends blow me off to go spend time with their boyfriends/girlfriends. It hurts to see couples at school. It hurts to see my friends having happy relationships on social media, posting about how much they love their partner, the gifts they give them. The relationships I have been in were almost always toxic. I have never dated anyone longer than a month before being dumped, sometimes ghosted. I had a boyfriend who was very abusive looking back. He hit me in my face. After I have my consensual virginity to him he broke up with me the day after. He seemed so nice. I never see it coming. I try to be a good girlfriend, I really do. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. A lot of guys say they find me attractive, or have crushes on me. But when I try to date someone it never works out. 


I feel like I’m always a second choice, if I’m even a choice at all. No one ever wrote me poems. My boyfriend forgot about my birthday. A girl I dated blew off our date to go get high. I recently quit social media, at least for awhile. I’m the only one out of my friend group who is single and it fucking hurts. I’ve never had anyone who was proud to be with me. No one ever put my name in their bio with a heart. No one ever called me out of the blue just to tell me they loved me. No one ever got me presents. No one ever talked about me. My bf told his friends that I was a slut and retarded because I rode the short bus. He told me never to tell anyone that we were dating, he refused to hold my hand in public. Now he’s had a new girlfriend for a year and treats her like a queen. They do everything together, and he constantly goes on about how amazing she is. His new gf used to be my friend. They still bully me sometimes.

To describe her as toxic wouldn't so much as scratch the surface. I've known of her type. I knew I shouldn't have involved myself. But I did. It was misery.

Depression is affected by multiple areas of our lives

I’m a big believer that three categories that need to be addressed at *the same time* to properly rewrire yourself are:

1.	Biological Self (chemical constituents of mind and body)
2.	Psychological Self (your behaviors and mental structures)
3.	Social Self (your network of friends and community)

Let’s cut to the chase, I’ll list things that I found helpful in each of these three categories.  I’ll list them in order of ease of access and implementation

###Biological Self Treatment pt.1 (body)

1.	**Good sleep hygiene**. Get 8 hours of sleep a day, sleep at the same time everyday.  Don’t complain about depression until you’ve handled this one. 
2.	**Cut out processed sugar and junk foods**.  Restrict your diet from having any of either.  These foods dramatically spike your insulin levels, and can really affect/burn out your adrenals
3.	**Start doing cardio with running or stationary cycling.** Start running a mile a week, and slowly build up from there.  You will begin to find yourself finding new areas around your city to see the nature.  Generally, this also prompts you to cut out unhealthy foods.

###Biological Self Treatment pt.2 (brain)

1.	**Start to take the crucial vitamins and amino acids**.  Get a good multivitamin such as Pure Encapsulation’s O.N.E. Vitamin
2.	Other crucial vitamins/amino acids related to depression are: Zinc, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin D &amp; K
3.	**Start taking a good probiotic**.  Make sure to find the refrigerated ones at a nicer market.  Your stomach is where most of your serotonin receptors are, if your gut isn’t happy, you literally won’t feel happy as well.
4.	**Start to experiment with nootropics** to see which work *for your unique chemistry*.  
5.	**Uridine** is a nootropic that in layman’s terms, resensatizes your dopamine receptors
6.	**Lion’s Mane** is *proven* to spur neurogenesis.  It is a mushroom that has been used for centuries for this purpose.  I purchase an extract capsule and take it daily with my microdoses.
7.	**Microdose Psilocybin.** Like Paul Stamets has talked about, taking psilocybin alongside lion’s mane almost certainly spurs neuronal growth – it just hasn’t been clinical studied much yet.  Studies are currently ongoing.

###Psychological Treatment

1.	**Start a journal.** Look into the Bullet Journal. 
2.	**Make a habit of doing daily inventories** of how you are feeling.  Also do daily successes and gratitudes 
3.	**Find a good therapist**.  There are a lot of different types of therapy that you should look into (EMDR, CBT, DBT)
4.	**Begin reading books.**  Books that I found very helpful were (Power of Habit, Philosophy for Life and Other Dangerous Situations, Checklist Manifesto, Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck)
5.	**Use your journal to begin creating dialogue with what you are reading**.  This is **crucial** as you can only grow as fast as your mind can advance itself.  If you are ruminating in the same thoughts, without writing back to yourself, you can escape at a fast enough velocity
6.	Note: this above section is *required* alongside the first sections, as **new neurons need new material to grasp onto to rewire**

###Social Self Treatment

1.	Sit down and **write out your values and goals in life**.  You can look into things such as the self-authoring tool by Jordan Peterson.  You need to orient your mind around society, and how you want to relate to it.  Therefor, deciding your values, and then your goals is *equally crucial* to all of the above to existing depression
2.	**Purchase and read “How to Win Friends and Influence People”**
3.	**Start to volunteer**.  A great way to meet people is to volunteer.  Everyone at these events are really nice and inviting
4.	**Start making new friends** with meetup apps like Eventbrite and Meetup
5.	At this point, your should also be leveling up your other 2 areas (Bio, Psycho) and your social life will begin to grow more rapidly as well.

I know this is a lot, but I’ve been doing all this over the past 2 years.  I was in a massive depression before then, and tried to commit suicide twice – it got so bad I was in the ICU for 10 days.

With this model of tackling crippling addiction, I was able to get to where I wanted to be, feeling pretty damn normal and happy

Remember, do step one in each of the three categories (Biological, Psychological, and Social) and only move up to the next step when you have done so. 

Just like a video game character, you want to try to evenly level up in each area in parallel. Each area will factor and effect the other ones.

But its really fucking hard. I'm used to eating so little at this point that food is just overwhelming.

rumors about me. didn’t bother me too much because i was getting help. my mom decided that my depression was not getting better after settling in my new home and having friends. i started a medication, and i had really bad side effects. hallucinations and delusions, the like. tried to end my life. 

summer before sophomore year, I moved back to my home state. it was cool. still depressed. but after my attempt I changed medications and started feeling a lot better. i never went to therapy after i moved because we couldn’t find any. so yeah. self healing from then on! 

i don’t really know how it happened but one day i woke up and realized i wasn’t who i was a few years ago. i wasn’t feeling suicidal, or horrible, or self hatred. i don’t know. maybe it was changing medication, or finding some friends, maybe it was finding my passion or moving home, maybe it was growing up or having a family to hold me when things became hard. maybe it was just time healing me. i don’t know. but last summer i realized i was a few months self harm free. this fall i passed 2 years of my first, last, and hopefully only suicide attempt. it was nice, feeling alive. sometimes i’m still sad, or have flashbacks or nightmares. but i have friends and family to rely on. this may marks 1 year of being self harm free. 

i’m getting a tattoo with parental permission for my 17th birthday. it’s going to cover up my self harm scars. put something beautiful and new, where something sad and filled with self hatred was. people can look at my arms with appreciation, or awe, or curiosity, instead of pity, or uncomfortable, or disgust.  (i admire those who can proudly wear their scars— don’t cover them up if you don’t want to! for me, it’s healing. for others, showing your scars is freeing and healing. i see you and love you!)  

it’s going to be a beautifully sleek raven, surrounded by flowers.

it’s been a wild 6 years. i’m extremely lucky to have the support i have. to have the quick recovery some don’t get. i don’t know where i was going with this. 

i’m just happy i’ve been alive for 17 years. alive and happy.",recovery!!,1578201213.0
670,Prisonneroftime,1578130404,"Hi. My name is Maxime. I am 27 years old. I am really depressed. Not to the point of taking my life away though, but i don't wanna get to that point. I don't know if this is the right place to post this text but i have no idea where to go to. So my story goes like this. I had a hard time in high school, getting bullied left and right, skipping class because of it. I still have a few very good friends from childhood though. I dropped school at age 16, not doing anything for about a year. I started to get panic attacks out of nowhere after that. I started working at Mcdonald's at age 18 and im still working there to this day. I hate it. I hate it with a passion. I feel trapped because i have nowhere else to go. I have no education at all to get any good job. Even if i wanted to, i have no motivation AT ALL in life. Even the smallest tasks seem like a ton of work. I also have addiction problems. I am addicted to Weed, cigarettes, energy drinks, gaming and sleep deprivation. My life is really a total mess. I met my girlfriend Vanessa at work. She's everything to me.  When i work, i wish i was at home playing video games even if i can't stand it anymore. Every single day of my life, the only thing i do all day long is play video games. On my days off i can spend over 12+ hours playing games. I don't know what else i could do. I wanna turn my life around but i don't know where to start. I want a good job, i want a fun life, i want a good future.. but all of this seems out of reach. I don't even have a driver's license either. I NEED help before i get to the point of no return... and i really don't want this to happen. I NEED to overcome this extreme lack of motivation and all i want in life is to be happy with the people i love. I don't care about money. I never cared about it. It's been so long since ive even had fun that i don't remember what it's like. How can i find motivation? How can i find happiness? How can i live a good life? How can i finally find motivation? It seems like an impossible task to me.... please help",How can i live? How can i turn my life around?,1578130404.0
671,joellevp,1578107891,"I was diagnosed with a condition last year, and one thing I have to deal with now is chronic pain. Only in the last couple of months, after a lot of physio, and just putting in the work I had to do, around and also with my depression (they play on each other truly), I found myself feeling quite strong. Pain was minimal, and the affected areas in my body had signifcant improvement. It's an empowering feeling to feel strong, especially when in so many areas I don't. To be able to put in the effort, and see a result, after months of trying. Again, a feeling of control when a lot of the time I've felt helpless and powerless.

A couple of weeks ago though, the doc fiddled with around to test the symptoms, and damn did they reappear in full force. I feel weak, I am in pain, I am uncomfortable. It is certainly something I didn't need this time of the year. 

Given my pain meds contribute to my insomnia rather than help me sleep, last night, I had to choose: feel less pain; or be able to get some sleep. I don't sleep well on normal days, I have a lot of vivid dreams and nightmares, and wake up constantly. Faced with this decision, it feels crippling.  It is not the first time I have faced it, but the fact that I had to face it again, I can't help but wonder how many times I have to sacrifice one or the other. Chronic is a hard word to come to terms with.

I got about 3 hours of sleep last night, right at the beginning. Woke up before 1 am and have been up since. I am tired, the pain, and discomfort have come back.

It is at these times all my bad habits come flooding back to me. And, all I am thinking is that I need a break. It can be terribly hard to try and hold yourself together, can't it?

673,croissantnoodle,1577985928,"Hi there, I don't even know if this is the right place for a post like this (if it's not tell me, I will delete it), but I just need to say that finally I feel better. 


I've been struggling with my mental health for years. For me it meant self harm, bad relationships to food and sleep, loads and loads of suicidal thoughts and a general feeling of anxiety (which led to medical issues years ago). It was so bad at one point I had to leave my country and family to try to find motivation to live. I'm French so I went to Ireland for a while, officially  to ""study abroad"". 
When I came back I still felt depressed and empty, but slightly better because I felt a slight sense of accomplishment in my year abroad. So everything was supposed to go well, right? I was gonna go a new school, meet new people and I my head it would all be sorted out eventually, someday, hopefully soon.
I was so wrong. The next 2 years of my life were frankly horrible. I've made friends, but I have never been so alone, on top of other forms of self harm I started cutting but I was so afraid of people seeing that I was cutting, that I only cut my legs and ankles, I started experiencing panic attacks, and I was really unstable in general. 
Overall my deepest fear was people (especially friends and family)  finding out how unwell I was because I thought I didn't deserve their care or attention. 
It was really a dark place for me

But a few month ago, I finally found something I want to do with my life. I was asked to illustrate a book, which I did and holy shit guys, this was awesome. For the first time ever I enjoyed something so much I want to do it again and again, until what goes on inside my head disappears!
When I draw, I feel like I can belong anywhere and everywhere at the same time, I WANT to learn new things, I have goals and expectations.
Also I realised how stupid it was to stand against my own problems alone, and I've surrounded myself with a handful of genuinely great and supportive people who can help me get better. 
Deep down I'm still scared of things going back to the way they were before, but for now I feel so much better. I can finally raise my head and breath, more importantly I want to move on with my life. 


That's it guys, I feel better after years of battle against myself and I hope to recover fully soon.

675,DepersonalizingCow,1577949340,"Long story short, I've struggled with gut and digestive problems for over two years. I'm swimming in vomit and medical bills. I've had to takes weeks off at a time from work and I keep bouncing from part-time job to part-time job because I need a medical break. 

And when I think about how unproductive being sick is, I start to think very self-destructive thoughts. My self worth feels completely tied to my work ethic and the amount of money I make. It's limiting my ability to rest and heal AND it's impacting my mental health.

676,SuicidalNomad,1577936955,"So I saw a video today (centered around another Reddit thread) that asked if any depressed people have hobbies.

I saw jigsaw puzzle (which bore me), bird watching, going for a walk, etc. Personally, I've been playing chess. I suck at it, granted, but for me it's about the struggle to survive until either I capture the king or my king is captured. I'm on a steady streak of draws right now, which is a sign that I'm improving, and that makes me feel good. I used to just give up whenever I knew I'd lose, but lately I can't stop playing the full game. It's also handy if I don't have the energy to actually get up and take a walk, I can just fire up my chess app.

Also learning languages on Duolingo or whatever ebook I've downloaded at the time is fun. It gives me this feeling of importance (?), like I'm an ancient scribe, trying to decipher long forgotten texts.

677,sofig132,1577919940,"So my mom knows about my depression for two and a half years now. I've made some progress since then like drastically lowering my anxiety, being more vocal and social and especially talking openly about my struggles. 

Every time I say something about this subject she gets quiet and looks bored and uninterested . I asked her a few times why she reacts that way to this subject and she said it's because she doesnt want me to talk about it so I wont get myself ""down"" or to a bad mood. But I've explained that not talking about this is what got me in so deep and made me internalize everything. And that talking about it is my way of dealing with it. 

She is very supportive every other way but not when it comes to actually talking about it. 

It's actually kinda hurtful for me when I know I cant really relly on her to talk about my struggles but at the same time she gets upset and sad when she finds out I've been hiding them .
